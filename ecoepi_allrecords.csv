4,N,Analysis of the Functional Relevance of Epigenetic Chromatin Marks in the First Intron Associated with Specific Gene Expression Patterns,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"We previously showed that the first intron of genes exhibits several interesting characteristics not seen in other introns: 1) it is the longest intron on average in almost all eukaryotes, 2) it presents the highest number of conserved sites, and 3) it exhibits the highest density of regulatory chromatin marks. Here, we expand on our previous study by integrating various multiomics data, leading to further evidence supporting the functionality of sites in the first intron. We first show that trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (TASs) are significantly enriched in the first intron. We also show that within the first intron, the density of epigenetic chromatin signals is higher near TASs than in distant regions. Furthermore, the distribution of several chromatin regulatory marks is investigated in relation to gene expression specificity (i.e., housekeeping vs. tissue-specific expression), essentiality (essential genes vs. nonessential genes), and levels of gene expression; housekeeping genes or essential genes contain greater proportions of active chromatin marks than tissue-specific genes or nonessential genes, and highly expressed genes exhibit a greater density of chromatin regulatory marks than genes with low expression. Moreover, we observe that genes carrying multiple first-intron TASs interact with each other within a large protein-protein interaction network, ultimately connecting to the UBC protein, awell-established protein involved in ubiquitination. We believe that our results shed light on the functionality of first introns as a genomic entity involved in gene expression regulation.",2019,11,786-797,10.1093/gbe/evz033
5,N,Changes in Gene Expression and DNA Methylation of Evolutionarily Young AluY Repeats during Apoptosis of Human K562 Erythro-Myeloblastic Leukemia Cells,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"Using a human K562 erythromyeloblastoid cell culture, we demonstrated changes in gene expression of Alu repeats, members of evolutionarily young AluY subfamilies (human mobile SINE elements), and in the DNA methylation level of AluYb8 during camptothecin (CAM)-induced apoptosis. The AluY-RNA level increased about 10 times 24 h and 20 times 48 h after exposure to CAM vs. proliferating cells. Using methylation-specific (MSP) PCR and high-resolution melting (HRM), we showed that the overall AluYb8-DNA methylation level remained intact throughout the apoptotic stages. Using DNA sequencing after bisulfite conversion, we established that at the CpG site, located in the A'-box of the AluYb8 gene promoter, the methylation level decreased significantly during different apoptotic stages. Apparently, it is reduced CpG methylation at the A'-box of the AluYb8 gene promoter, discovered in this work, that is one of the possible factors which account for increased expression of AluY repeats during K562 cell apoptosis. We assume that increased gene expression of evolutionarily young AluY repeats plays an important role in the implementation of the cellular apoptotic pathway.",2018,54,30-42,10.1134/S0022093018010040

9,N,Comparative Methylome Analyses Identify Epigenetic Regulatory Loci of Human Brain Evolution,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"How do epigenetic modifications change across species and how do these modifications affect evolution? These are fundamental questions at the forefront of our evolutionary epigenomic understanding. Our previous work investigated human and chimpanzee brain methylomes, but it was limited by the lack of outgroup data which is critical for comparative (epi) genomic studies. Here, we compared whole genome DNA methylation maps from brains of humans, chimpanzees and also rhesus macaques (outgroup) to elucidate DNA methylation changes during human brain evolution. Moreover, we validated that our approach is highly robust by further examining 38 human-specific DMRs using targeted deep genomic and bisulfite sequencing in an independent panel of 37 individuals from five primate species. Our unbiased genome-scan identified human brain differentially methylated regions (DMRs), irrespective of their associations with annotated genes. Remarkably, over half of the newly identified DMRs locate in intergenic regions or gene bodies. Nevertheless, their regulatory potential is on par with those of promoter DMRs. An intriguing observation is that DMRs are enriched in active chromatin loops, suggesting human-specific evolutionary remodeling at a higher-order chromatin structure. These findings indicate that there is substantial reprogramming of epigenomic landscapes during human brain evolution involving noncoding regions.",2016,33,2947-2959,10.1093/molbev/msw176
10,N,Developmental stress and cranial hypostosis by epigenetic trait occurrence and distribution: An exploratory study on the Italian Neandertals,JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,"The occurrence and distribution of 35 cranial epigenetic traits in the Italian Neandertals (Saccopastore 1 and 2, Gualtari 1) were examined according to morpho-functional cranial regions and with respect to a distinction between hypostosis (i.e., weak osseous development, arrested morphogenesis, retention of infantile features) and hyperostosis (i.e. excess of ossification, not reaching the pathological condition); The results, expressed as hypostotic scores, showed higher levels of hypostosis in these Neandertal specimens than in recent European samples. The highest expressions of hypostotis were observed in those regions of the Neandertal cranium where disequilibrium between skeletal and cerebral growth factors was expected. These results-interpreted as expression of developmental stress-are consistent with a heterochronic interpretation of the development of the Neandertal cranium; namely, a faster ossification of the cranial vault relative to brain growth rates.

11,N,Differences in DNA Methylation Patterns and Expression of the CCRK Gene in Human and Nonhuman Primate Cortices,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Changes in DNA methylation patterns during embryo development and differentiation processes are linked to the transcriptional plasticity of our genome. However, little is known about the evolutionary conservation of DNA methylation patterns and the evolutionary impact of epigenetic differences between closely related species. Here we compared the methylation patterns of CpG islands (CGIs) in the promoter regions of seven genes in humans and chimpanzees. We identified a block of CpGs in the cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) gene that is more methylated in the adult human cortex than in the chimpanzee cortex and, in addition, it exhibits considerable intraspecific variation both in humans and chimpanzees. The species-specifically methylated region (SMR) lies between the almost completely methylated 5' region and the completely demethylated 3' region of the presumed CCRK CGI promoter. It is part of an Alu-Sg1 repeat that has been integrated into the promoter region in a common ancestor of humans and New World monkeys. This SMR is relatively hypomethylated in the rhesus monkey cortex and more or less completely methylated in the baboon cortex, indicating extraordinary methylation dynamics during primate evolution. The mRNA expression level of CCRK has also changed during the course of primate evolution. CCRK is expressed at much higher levels in human and baboon cortices, which display an average SMR methylation of 70% and 100%, respectively, than in chimpanzee and rhesus macaque cortices with an average SMR methylation of 35% and 40%, respectively. The observed evolutionary dynamics suggests a possibility that CCRK has been important for evolution of the primate brain.",2009,26,1379-1389,10.1093/molbev/msp046
12,N,DNA methylation at stress-related genes is associated with exposure to early life institutionalization,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"ObjectivesDifferences in DNA methylation have been associated with early life adversity, suggesting that alterations in methylation function as one pathway through which adverse early environments are biologically embedded. This study examined associations between exposure to institutional care, quantified as the proportion of time in institutional care at specified follow-up assessment ages, and DNA methylation status in two stress-related genes: FKBP5 and SLC6A4. Materials and MethodsWe analyzed data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, which is a prospective study in which children reared in institutional settings were randomly assigned (mean age 22 months) to either newly created foster care or care as usual (to remain in their current placement) and prospectively followed. A group of children from the same geographic area, with no history of institutionalized caregiving, were also recruited. DNA methylation status was determined in DNA extracted from buccal epithelial cells of children at age 12. ResultsAn inverse association was identified such that more time spent in institutional care was associated with lower DNA methylation at specific CpG sites within both genes. DiscussionThese results suggest a lasting impact of early severe social deprivation on methylation patterns in these genes, and contribute to a growing literature linking early adversity and epigenetic variation in children.

13,N,DNA methylation of methylation complex genes in relation to stress and genome-wide methylation in mother-newborn dyads,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"ObjectivesEarly life stress is known to have enduring biological effects, particularly with respect to health. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are a possible mechanism to mediate the biological effect of stress. We previously found correlations between maternal stress, newborn birthweight, and genome-wide measures of DNA methylation. Here we investigate ten genes related to the methylation/demethylation complex in order to better understand the impact of stress on health. Materials and methodsDNA methylation and genetic variants at methylation/demethylation genes were assayed. Mean methylation measures were constructed for each gene and tested, in addition to genetic variants, for association with maternal stress measures based on interview and survey data (chronic stress and war trauma), maternal venous, and newborn cord genome-wide mean methylation (GMM), and birthweight. ResultsAfter cell type correction, we found multiple pairwise associations between war trauma, maternal GMM, maternal methylation at DNMT1, DNMT3A, TET3, and MBD2, and birthweight. ConclusionsThe association of maternal GMM and maternal methylation at DNMT1, DNMT3A, TET3, and MBD2 is consistent with the role of these genes in establishing, maintaining and altering genome-wide methylation patterns, in some cases in response to stress. DNMT1 produces one of the primary enzymes that reproduces methylation patterns during DNA replication. DNMT3A and TET3 have been implicated in genome-wide hypomethylation in response to glucocorticoid hormones. Although we cannot determine the directionality of the genic and genome-wide changes in methylation, our results suggest that altered methylation of specific methylation genes may be part of the molecular mechanism underlying the human biological response to stress.",2018,165,173-182,10.1002/ajpa.23341
14,N,"Epigenetic Variability across Human Populations: A Focus on DNA Methylation Profiles of the KRTCAP3, MAD1L1 and BRSK2 Genes",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Natural epigenetic diversity has been suggested as a key mechanism in microevolutionary processes due to its capability to create phenotypic variability within individuals and populations. It constitutes an important reservoir of variation potentially useful for rapid adaptation in response to environmental stimuli. The analysis of population epigenetic structure represents a possible tool to study human adaptation and to identify external factors that are able to naturally shape human DNA methylation variability. The aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics that create epigenetic diversity between and within different human groups. To this end, we first used publicly available epigenome-wide data to explore population-specific DNA methylation changes that occur at macro-geographic scales. Results from this analysis suggest that nutrients. UVA exposure and pathogens load might represent the main environmental factors able to shape DNA methylation profiles. Then, we evaluated DNA methylation of candidate genes (KRTCAP3. MAD1L1, and BRSK2), emerged from the previous analysis, in individuals belonging to different populations from Morocco, Nigeria, Philippines, China, and Italy, but living in the same Italian city. DNA methylation of the BRSK2 gene is significantly different between Moroccans and Nigerians (pairwise t-test: CpG 6 P-value = 5.2*10(-3); CpG 9 P-value =2.6*10(-3); CpG 10 P-value =3.1*10(-3); CpG 11 P-value = 2.8*10(-3)). Comprehensively, these results suggest that DNA methylation diversity is a source of variability in human groups at macro and microgeographical scales and that population demographic and adaptive histories, as well as the individual ancestry, actually influence DNA methylation profiles.",2016,8,2760-2773,10.1093/gbe/evw186
15,N,Evolutionary Origin and Methylation Status of Human Intronic CpG Islands that Are Not Present in Mouse,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Imprinting of the human RB1 gene is due to the presence of a differentially methylated CpG island (CGI) in intron 2, which is part of a retrocopy derived from the PPP1R26 gene on chromosome 9. The murine Rb1 gene does not have this retrocopy and is not imprinted. We have investigated whether the RB1 b1 locus is unique with respect to these differences. For this, we have compared the CGIs from human and mouse by in silico analyses. We have found that the human genome does not only contain more CGIs than the mouse, but the proportion of intronic CGIs is also higher (7.7% vs. 3.5%). At least 2,033 human intronic CGIs are not present in the mouse. Among these CGIs, 104 show sequence similarities elsewhere in the human genome, which suggests that they arose from retrotransposition. We could narrow down the time points when most of these CGIs appeared during evolution. Their methylation status was analyzed in two monocyte methylome data sets from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and in 18 published methylomes. Four CGIs, which are located in the RB1, ASRGL1, PARP11, and PDXDC1 genes, occur as methylated and unmethylated copies. In contrast to imprinted methylation at the RB1 locus, differential methylation of the ASRGL1 and PDXDC1 CGIs appears to be sequence dependent. Our study supports the notion that the epigenetic fate of the retrotransposed DNA depends on its sequence and selective forces at the integration site.",2014,6,1579-1588,10.1093/gbe/evu125
16,N,"Fast, Accurate and Automatic Ancient Nucleosome and Methylation Maps with epiPALEOMIX",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The first epigenomes from archaic hominins (AH) and ancient anatomically modern humans (AMH) have recently been characterized, based, however, on a limited number of samples. The extent to which ancient genome-wide epigenetic landscapes can be reconstructed thus remains contentious. Here, we present epiPALEOMIX, an open-source and user-friendly pipeline that exploits post-mortem DNA degradation patterns to reconstruct ancient methylomes and nucleosome maps from shotgun and/or capture-enrichment data. Applying epiPALEOMIX to the sequence data underlying 35 ancient genomes including AMH, AH, equids and aurochs, we investigate the temporal, geographical and preservation range of ancient epigenetic signatures. We first assess the quality of inferred ancient epigenetic signatures within well-characterized genomic regions. We find that tissue-specific methylation signatures can be obtained across a wider range of DNA preparation types than previously thought, including when no particular experimental procedures have been used to remove deaminated cytosines prior to sequencing. We identify a large subset of samples for which DNA associated with nucleosomes is protected from post-mortem degradation, and nucleosome positioning patterns can be reconstructed. Finally, we describe parameters and conditions such as DNA damage levels and sequencing depth that limit the preservation of epigenetic signatures in ancient samples. When such conditions are met, we propose that epigenetic profiles of CTCF binding regions can be used to help data authentication. Our work, including epiPALEOMIX, opens for further investigations of ancient epigenomes through time especially aimed at tracking possible epigenetic changes during major evolutionary, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural shifts.",2016,33,3284-3298,10.1093/molbev/msw184
17,N,Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in relation to socioeconomic status during development and early adulthood,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"Objectives Socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful determinant of health, but the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigates whether levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites across the genome are associated with SES in a cohort of young adults in the Philippines. Methods DNA methylation was assayed with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip, in leukocytes from 489 participants in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (mean age = 20.9 years). SES was measured in infancy/childhood and adulthood, and was based on composite measures of income, assets, and education. Genome-wide analysis of variable probes identified CpG sites significantly associated with SES after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Functional enrichment analysis was used to identify biological pathways associated with these sites. Results A total of 2,546 CpG sites, across 1,537 annotated genes, were differentially methylated in association with SES. In comparison with high SES, low SES was associated with increased methylation at 1,777 sites, and decreased methylation at 769 sites. Functional enrichment analysis identified over-representation of biological pathways related to immune function, skeletal development, and development of the nervous system. Conclusions Socioeconomic status predicts DNA methylation at a large number of CpG sites across the genome. The scope of these associations is commensurate with the wide range of biological systems and health outcomes that are shaped by SES, and these findings suggest that DNA methylation may play an important role.",2019,169,11-Mar,10.1002/ajpa.23800
18,N,Genome-wide DNA methylation analyses in the brain reveal four differentially methylated regions between humans and non-human primates,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: The highly improved cognitive function is the most significant change in human evolutionary history. Recently, several large-scale studies reported the evolutionary roles of DNA methylation; however, the role of DNA methylation on brain evolution is largely unknown. Results: To test if DNA methylation has contributed to the evolution of human brain, with the use of MeDIP-Chip and SEQUENOM MassARRAY, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the brain between humans and rhesus macaques. We first identified a total of 150 candidate DMRs by the MeDIP-Chip method, among which 4 DMRs were confirmed by the MassARRAY analysis. All 4 DMRs are within or close to the CpG islands, and a MIR3 repeat element was identified in one DMR, but no repeat sequence was observed in the other 3 DMRs. For the 4 DMR genes, their proteins tend to be conserved and two genes have neural related functions. Bisulfite sequencing and phylogenetic comparison among human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque and rat suggested several regions of lineage specific DNA methylation, including a human specific hypomethylated region in the promoter of K6IRS2 gene. Conclusions: Our study provides a new angle of studying human brain evolution and understanding the evolutionary role of DNA methylation in the central nervous system. The results suggest that the patterns of DNA methylation in the brain are in general similar between humans and non-human primates, and only a few DMRs were identified.",2012,12,144,10.1186/1471-2148-12-144
19,N,Global DNA methylation (LINE-1) associated with exposure to arsenic-contaminated environment and with type of arsenical skin lesions in Thailand,HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT,"The effects of chronic arsenic exposure mode on DNA methylation and skin lesion type are unclear. These relationships were investigated in an arsenic-contaminated area of southern Thailand. Cases with arsenical skin lesions (n = 131) and lesion-free controls (n = 163) were selected from an arsenic-contaminated sub-district, as well as 105 controls from a non-contaminated area. Type and severity of skin lesions and salivary global DNA methylation (LINE-1) were determined. Arsenic exposure was characterized as occupational, domestic and current (toe-nail arsenic). Associations were explored using logistic regression. Cases and controls had lower LINE-1 methylation and higher toenail arsenic than external controls (74.65% and 74.61% vs 76.05%, p < 0.001 for each). Cases were more likely to have been exposed domestically (ORtotal 1.76, 95% ci 1.00, 3.11; and 2.22, 95% ci 1.22, 4.03; P-trend = 0.005 for exposure <36 and >= 36 years). More severe spotty hyperpigmentation was related to higher LINE-1 methylation (P-trend=0.006). LINE-1 methylation was positively associated with toenail arsenic only among non-symptomatic exposed subjects (OR 1.31, 95% ci 1.06, 1.64; p = 0.014). Exposure to an arsenic-contaminated environment results in global DNA hypomethylation. However, among symptomatic subjects, increased global DNA methylation was associated with increased severity of spotty hyperpigmentation.",2019,25,688-705,10.1080/10807039.2018.1448968
20,N,"Impacts of Pretranscriptional DNA Methylation, Transcriptional Transcription Factor, and Posttranscriptional microRNA Regulations on Protein Evolutionary Rate",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Gene expression is largely regulated by DNA methylation, transcription factor (TF), and microRNA (miRNA) before, during, and after transcription, respectively. Although the evolutionary effects of TF/miRNA regulations have been widely studied, evolutionary analysis of simultaneously accounting for DNA methylation, TF, and miRNA regulations and whether promoter methylation and gene body (coding regions) methylation have different effects on the rate of gene evolution remain uninvestigated. Here, we compared human-macaque and human-mouse protein evolutionary rates against experimentally determined single base-resolution DNA methylation data, revealing that promoter methylation level is positively correlated with protein evolutionary rates but negatively correlated with TF/miRNA regulations, whereas the opposite was observed for gene body methylation level. Our results showed that the relative importance of these regulatory factors in determining the rate of mammalian protein evolution is as follows: Promoter methylation approximate to miRNA regulation > gene body methylation > TF regulation, and further indicated that promoter methylation and miRNA regulation have a significant dependent effect on protein evolutionary rates. Although the mechanisms underlying cooperation between DNA methylation and TFs/miRNAs in gene regulation remain unclear, our study helps to not only illuminate the impact of these regulatory factors on mammalian protein evolution but also their intricate interaction within gene regulatory networks.",2014,6,1530-1541,10.1093/gbe/evu124
21,N,Inferring chronological age from DNA methylation patterns of human teeth,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"ObjectiveCurrent methods to determine chronological age from modern and ancient remains rely on both morphological and molecular approaches. However, low accuracy and the lack of standardized protocols make the development of alternative methods for the estimation of individual's age even more urgent for several research fields, such as biological anthropology, biodemography, forensics, evolutionary genetics, and ancient DNA studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify genomic regions whose DNA methylation level correlates with age in modern teeth. MethodsWe used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to analyze DNA methylation levels of specific CpGs located in the ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes. We considered methylation data from cementum, dentin and pulp of 21 modern teeth (from 17 to 77 years old) to construct a mathematical model able to exploit DNA methylation values to predict age of the individuals. ResultsThe median difference between the real age and that estimated using DNA methylation values is 1.20 years (SD=1.9) if DNA is recovered from both cementum and pulp of the same modern teeth, 2.25 years (SD=2.5) if DNA is recovered from dental pulp, 2.45 years (SD=3.3) if DNA is extracted from cementum and 7.07 years (SD=7.0) when DNA is recovered from dentin only. DiscussionWe propose for the first time the evaluation of DNA methylation at ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes as a powerful tool to predict age in modern teeth for anthropological applications. Future studies are needed to apply this method also to historical and relatively ancient human teeth. Am J Phys Anthropol 159:585-595, 2016.

22,N,Integration of single nucleotide variants and whole-genome DNA methylation profiles for classification of rheumatoid arthritis cases from controls,HEREDITY,"This study evaluated the use of multiomics data for classification accuracy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Three approaches were used and compared in terms of prediction accuracy: (1) whole-genome prediction (WGP) using SNP marker information only, (2) whole-methylome prediction (WMP) using methylation profiles only, and (3) whole-genome/methylome prediction (WGMP) with combining both omics layers. The number of SNP and of methylation sites varied in each scenario, with either 1, 10, or 50% of these preselected based on four approaches: randomly, evenly spaced, lowest p value (genome-wide association or epigenome-wide association study), and estimated effect size using a Bayesian ridge regression (BRR) model. To remove effects of high levels of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD), SNPs were also preselected with an LD-pruning method. Five Bayesian regression models were studied for classification, including BRR, Bayes-A, Bayes-B, Bayes-C, and the Bayesian LASSO. Adjusting methylation profiles for cellular heterogeneity within whole blood samples had a detrimental effect on the classification ability of the models. Overall, WGMP using Bayes-B model has the best performance. In particular, selecting SNPs based on LD-pruning with 1% of the methylation sites selected based on BRR included in the model, and fitting the most significant SNP as a fixed effect was the best method for predicting disease risk with a classification accuracy of 0.975. Our results showed that multiomics data can be used to effectively predict the risk of RA and identify cases in early stages to prevent or alter disease progression via appropriate interventions.",2020,124,658-674,10.1038/s41437-020-0301-4
23,N,"Specific Modifications of Histone Tails, but Not DNA Methylation, Mirror the Temporal Variation of Mammalian Recombination Hotspots",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Recombination clusters nonuniformly across mammalian genomes at discrete genomic loci referred to as recombination hotspots. Despite their ubiquitous presence, individual hotspots rapidly lose their activities, and the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying such frequent hotspot turnovers (the so-called recombination hotspot paradox) remain unresolved. Even though some sequence motifs are significantly associated with hotspots, multiple lines of evidence indicate that factors other than underlying sequences, such as epigenetic modifications, may affect the evolution of recombination hotspots. Thus, identifying epigenetic factors that covary with recombination at fine-scale is a promising step for this important research area. It was previously reported that recombination rates correlate with indirect measures of DNA methylation in the human genome. Here, we analyze experimentally determined DNA methylation and histone modification of human sperms, and show that the correlation between DNA methylation and recombination in long-range windows does not hold with respect to the spatial and temporal variation of recombination at hotspots. On the other hand, two histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) overlap extensively with recombination hotspots. Similar trends were observed in mice. These results indicate that specific histone modifications rather than DNA methylation are associated with the rapid evolution of recombination hotspots. Furthermore, many human recombination hotspots occupy bivalent chromatin regions that harbor both active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) marks. This may explain why human recombination hotspots tend to occur in nongenic regions, in contrast to yeast and Arabidopsis hotspots that are characterized by generally active chromatins. Our results highlight the dynamic epigenetic underpinnings of recombination hotspot evolution.",2014,6,2918-2929,10.1093/gbe/evu230
24,N,Worldwide patterns of human epigenetic variation,NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification, influenced by both genetic and environmental variation, that plays a key role in transcriptional regulation and many organismal phenotypes. Although patterns of DNA methylation have been shown to differ between human populations, it remains to be determined how epigenetic diversity relates to the patterns of genetic and gene expression variation at a global scale. Here we measured DNA methylation at 485,000 CpG sites in five diverse human populations, and analysed these data together with genome-wide genotype and gene expression data. We found that population-specific DNA methylation mirrors genetic variation, and has greater local genetic control than mRNA levels. We estimated the rate of epigenetic divergence between populations, which indicates far greater evolutionary stability of DNA methylation in humans than has been observed in plants. This study provides a deeper understanding of worldwide patterns of human epigenetic diversity, as well as initial estimates of the rate of epigenetic divergence in recent human evolution.",2017,1,1577-1583,10.1038/s41559-017-0299-z
25,N,A Genomic Imprinting Model of Termite Caste Determination: Not Genetic but Epigenetic Inheritance Influences Offspring Caste Fate,AMERICAN NATURALIST,"Eusocial insects exhibit the most striking example of phenotypic plasticity. There has been a long controversy over the factors determining caste development of individuals in social insects. Here we demonstrate that parental phenotypes influence the social status of offspring not through genetic inheritance but through genomic imprinting in termites. Our extensive field survey and genetic analysis of the termite Reticulitermes speratus show that its breeding system is inconsistent with a genetic caste determination model. We therefore developed a genomic imprinting model, in which queen- and king-specific epigenetic marks antagonistically influence sexual development of offspring. The model accounts for all known empirical data on caste differentiation of R. speratus and other related species. By conducting colony-founding experiments and additively incorporating relevant socio-environmental factors into our genomic imprinting model, we show the relative importance of genomic imprinting and environmental factors in caste determination. The idea of epigenetic inheritance of sexual phenotypes solves the puzzle of why parthenogenetically produced daughters carrying only maternal chromosomes exclusively develop into queens and why parental phenotypes (nymph- or worker-derived reproductives) strongly influence caste differentiation of offspring. According to our model, the worker caste is seen as a neuter caste whose sexual development is suppressed due to counterbalanced maternal and paternal imprinting and opens new avenues for understanding the evolution of caste systems in social insects.",2018,191,677-690,10.1086/697238
26,N,A Neutrality Test for Detecting Selection on DNA Methylation Using Single Methylation Polymorphism Frequency Spectrum,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Inheritable epigenetic mutations (epimutations) can contribute to transmittable phenotypic variation. Thus, epimutations can be subject to natural selection and impact the fitness and evolution of organisms. Based on the framework of the modified Tajima's D test for DNA mutations, we developed a neutrality test with the statistic D-m to detect selection forces on DNA methylation mutations using single methylation polymorphisms. With computer simulation and empirical data analysis, we compared the D-m test with the original and modified Tajima's D tests and demonstrated that the D-m test is suitable for detecting selection on epimutations and outperforms original/modified Tajima's D tests. Due to the higher resetting rate of epimutations, the interpretation of D-m on epimutations and Tajima's D test on DNA mutations could be different in inferring natural selection. Analyses using simulated and empirical genome-wide polymorphism data suggested that genes under genetic and epigenetic selections behaved differently. We applied the D-m test to recently originated Arabidopsis and human genes, and showed that newly evolved genes contain higher level of rare epialleles, suggesting that epimutation may play a role in origination and evolution of genes and genomes. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of the D-m test to detect whether the loci are under selection regarding DNA methylation. Our analytical metrics and methodology could contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes of genes and genomes in the field of epigenetics.

28,N,Adjusting to Global Change through Clonal Growth and Epigenetic Variation,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The earth is experiencing major changes in global and regional climates and changes are predicted to accelerate in the future. Many species will be under considerable pressure to evolve, to migrate, or be faced with extinction. Clonal plants would appear to be at a particular disadvantage due to their limited mobility and limited capacity for adaptation. However, they have outlived previous environmental shifts and clonal species have persisted for millenia. Clonal spread offers unique ecological advantages, such as resource sharing, risk sharing, and economies of scale among ramets within genotypes. We suggest that ecological attributes of clonal plants, in tandem with variation in gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate and optimize phenotype variation in response to environmental change may permit them to be well suited to projected conditions.",2016,4,86,10.3339/fevo.2016.00086
29,N,Alternative epigenetic states understood in terms of specific regulatory structures,FROM EPIGENESIS TO EPIGENETICS: THE GENOME IN CONTEXT,"Generally speaking, epigenetic states or epigenetic regulation refer to situations in which several states of gene,expression may coexist in similar environmental conditions, despite the absence of significant changes in the genomic sequence. In one way or another, the mechanisms behind these phenomena involve vicious circles, so that each epigenetic. state tends to sustain itself, even after the disappearance of the inductive signal involved in the selection of that particular state. These vicious circles constitute positive feedback circuits and are found at the core of many developmental regulatory systems. In this paper, we present a qualitative model for the regulatory network formed by maternal and gap gene crossregulations. This network controls the initial anterior-posterior patterning during early Drosophila embryogenesis and encompasses several intertwined feedback circuits. On the basis of our model analysis, we derive interesting insights about how specific expression states of the gap genes are selected along the anterior-posterior axis, in particular in relation with the activity of one positive feedback circuit, namely that formed by giant and Kruppel cross-inhibitions. In addition, we are able to qualitatively simulate the patterns of gene expression in the wild-type, as well as to predict the phenotypes of various loss-of-function mutations at the maternal and gap genes, or cis-regulatory mutations at the gap genes, as well as the effects of ectopic expression of these genes.",2002,981,135-153,
30,N,An Epigenetic Model for Pigment Patterning Based on Mechanical and Cellular Interactions,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,"Pigment patterning in animals generally occurs during early developmental stages and has ecological, physiological, ethological, and evolutionary significance. Despite the relative simplicity of color patterns, their emergence depends upon multilevel complex processes. Thus, theoretical models have become necessary tools to further understand how such patterns emerge. Recent studies have reevaluated the importance of epigenetic, as well as genetic factors in developmental pattern formation. Yet epigenetic phenomena, specially those related to physical constraints that might be involved in the emergence of color patterns, have not been fully studied. In this article, we propose a model of color patterning in which epigenetic aspects such as cell migration, celltissue interactions, and physical and mechanical phenomena are central. This model considers that motile cells embedded in a fibrous, viscoelastic matrixmesenchymecan deform it in such a way that tension tracks are formed. We postulate that these tracks act, in turn, as guides for subsequent cell migration and establishment, generating long-range phenomenological interactions. We aim to describe some general aspects of this developmental phenomenon with a rather simple mathematical model. Then we discuss our model in the context of available experimental and morphological evidence for reptiles, amphibians, and fishes, and compare it with other patterning models. We also put forward novel testable predictions derived from our model, regarding, for instance, the localization of the postulated tension tracks, and we propose new experiments. Finally, we discuss how the proposed mechanism could constitute a dynamic patterning module accounting for pattern formation in many animal lineages. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 318:209223, 2012.

31,N,An Insight into the Secondary Metabolism of Muscodor yucatanensis: Small-Molecule Epigenetic Modifiers Induce Expression of Secondary Metabolism-Related Genes and Production of New Metabolites in the Endophyte,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Muscodor spp. are proficient producers of bioactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with many potential applications. However, all members of this genus produce varying amounts and types of VOCs which suggests the involvement of epigenetics as a possible explanation. The members of this genus are poorly explored for the production of soluble compounds (extrolites). In this study, the polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes from an endophyte, Muscodor yucatanensis Ni30, were cloned and sequenced. The PKS genes belonged to reduced, partially reduced, non-reduced, and highly reduced subtypes. Strains over-expressing PKS genes were developed through the use of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and 5azacytidine). The putative epigenetic variants of this organism differed considerably from the wild type in morphological features and cultural characteristics as well as metabolites that were produced. Each variant produced a different set of VOCs distinct from the wild type, and several VOCs including methyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) hexane-2,4-diol and 2-carboxymethyl-3-n-hexylmaleic appeared in the variant strains, the production of which could be attributed to the activity of otherwise silent PKS genes. The bioactive extrolite brefeldin A was isolated and characterized from the wild type. However, this metabolite was not detected in EV-1, but instead, two other products were isolated and characterized as ergosterol and xylaguaianol C. Hence, M. yucatanensis has the genetic potential to produce several previously undetectable VOCs and organic solvent soluble products. It is also the case that small-molecule epigenetic modifiers can be used to produce stable variant strains of fungi with the potential to produce new molecules. Finally, this work hints to the prospect that the epigenetics of an endophytic microorganism can be influenced by any number of environmental and chemical factors associated with its host plant which may help to explain the enormous chemical diversity of secondary metabolic products found in Muscodor spp.",2017,73,954-965,10.1007/s00248-016-0901-y

35,N,Biogeochemical factors affecting mercury methylation rate in two contaminated floodplain soils,BIOGEOSCIENCES,"An automated biogeochemical microcosm system allowing controlled variation of redox potential (EH) in soil suspensions was used to assess the effect of various factors on the mobility of mercury (Hg) as well as on the methylation of Hg in two contaminated floodplain soils with different Hg concentrations (approximately 5 mg Hg kg(-1) and > 30 mg Hg kg(-1)). The experiment was conducted under stepwise variation from reducing (approximately -350 mV at pH 5) to oxidizing conditions (approximately 600 mV at pH 5). Results of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis indicate the occurrence of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) such as Desulfobacter species (10Me16:0, cy17:0, 10Me18:0, cy19:0) or Desulfovibrio species (18:2 omega 6,9), which are considered to promote Hg methylation. The products of the methylation process are lipophilic, highly toxic methyl mercury species such as the monomethyl mercury ion [MeHg+], which is named as MeHg here. The ln(MeHg/Hg-t) ratio is assumed to reflect the net production of monomethyl mercury normalized to total dissolved Hg (Hg-t) concentration. This ratio increases with rising dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to Hg-t ratio (ln(DOC/Hg-t) ratio) (R-2 = 0.39, p < 0.0001, n = 63) whereas the relation between ln(MeHg/Hg-t) ratio and lnDOC is weaker (R-2 = 0.09; p < 0.05; n = 63). In conclusion, the DOC/Hg-t ratio might be a more important factor for the Hg net methylation than DOC alone in the current study. Redox variations seem to affect the biogeochemical behavior of dissolved inorganic Hg species and MeHg indirectly through related changes in DOC, sulfur cycle, and microbial community structure whereas EH and pH values, as well as concentration of dissolved Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cl-seem to play subordinate roles in Hg mobilization and methylation under our experimental conditions.",2012,9,493-507,10.5194/bg-9-493-2012
36,N,Change in maternal environment induced by cross-fostering alters genetic and epigenetic effects on complex traits in mice,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"The interaction between maternally provided environment and offspring genotype is a major determinant of offspring development and fitness in many organisms. Recent research has demonstrated that not only genetic effects, but also epigenetic effects may be subject to modifications by the maternal environment. Genomic imprinting resulting in parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression is among the best studied of epigenetic effects. However, very little is known about the degree to which genomic imprinting effects can be modulated by the maternally provided environment, which has important implications for phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we investigated this unresolved question using a cross-fostering design in which mouse pups were nursed by either their own or an unrelated mother. We scanned the entire genome to search for quantitative trait loci whose effects depend on cross-fostering and detected 10 of such loci. Of the 10 loci, 4 showed imprinting by cross-foster interactions. Inmost cases, the interaction effect was due to the presence of an effect in either cross-fostered or non-cross-fostered animals. Our results demonstrate that genomic imprinting effects may often be modified by the maternal environment and that such interactions can impact key fitness-related traits suggesting a greater plasticity of genomic imprinting than previously assumed.",2009,276,2949-2954,10.1098 spb.2009.0515
37,N,Complex Marine Natural Products as Potential Epigenetic and Production Regulators of Antibiotics from a Marine Pseudomonas aeruginosa,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Marine microbes are capable of producing secondary metabolites for defense and competition. Factors exerting an impact on secondary metabolite production of microbial communities included bioactive natural products and co-culturing. These external influences may have practical applications such as increased yields or the generation of new metabolites from otherwise silent genes in addition to reducing or limiting the production of undesirable metabolites. In this paper, we discuss the metabolic profiles of a marine Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of a number of potential chemical epigenetic regulators, adjusting carbon sources and co-culturing with other microbes to induce a competitive response. As a result of these stressors certain groups of antibiotics or antimalarial agents were increased most notably when treating P. aeruginosa with sceptrin and co-culturing with another Pseudomonas sp. An interesting cross-talking event between these two Pseudomonas species when cultured together and exposed to sceptrin was observed.",2013,65,1068-1075,10.1007/s00248-013-0213-4
38,N,Cytosine methylation is not the major factor inducing CpG dinucleotide deficiency in bacterial genomes,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,"CpG dinucleotide deficiency has been found in viruses, mitochondria, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. The consensual explanation is that it is due to deamination of methylated cytosines, as established for vertebrate and plants. However, we still do not know whether C5 cytosine methylation is also the mal. or cause of CpG deficiency in bacteria. By combining annotation and experimental data identifying the presence of C5 cytosine methyltransferases with analysis of CpG relative abundance in 67 bacterial species, we found that CpG relative abundance in most bacterial genomes that have cytosine C5 methyltransferases tends to be in the normal range (observed/expected values between 0.82 and 1.21). In contrast, many bacterial species likely to be lacking C5 cytosine methylation showed CpG deficiency. Furthermore, when comparing genomes with one another, TpG and CpA relative abundances were found to be independent from CpG relative abundance. This contrasted with intragenome analyses, where C(3)pG(1) relative abundance (the subscripts refer to position of a nucleotide in a codon) was found to be generally positively correlated with T(3)pG(1) relative abundances when plotted against GC content in protein coding sequences (CDSs). This suggests the existence of alternative mechanisms contributing to CpG deficiency in bacteria.",2004,58,692-700,10.1007/s00239-004-2591-1

These include genetic effects, transgenerational epigenetic influences, environmental cues and developmental noise, which are rarely investigated in the same formal framework. We study an analytically tractable evolutionary model, in which cues are integrated to determine mature phenotypes in fluctuating environments. Environmental cues received during development and by the mother as an adult act as detection-based (individually observed) cues. The mother's phenotype and a quantitative genetic effect act as selection-based cues (they correlate with environmental states after selection). We specify when such cues are complementary and tend to be used together, and when using the most informative cue will predominate. Thus, we extend recent analyses of the evolutionary implications of subsets of these effects by providing a general diagnosis of the conditions under which detection and selection-based influences on development are likely to evolve and coexist.",2016,19,1267-1276,10.1111/ele.12663

42,N,Development of the adenohypophysis in the lamprey: Evolution of epigenetic patterning programs in organogenesis,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,"In gnathostomes, the adenohypophysis, a component of the hypothalamo-hypophysial complex, is believed to develop through hierarchically organized epigenetic interactions based primarily on the topographical relationships between tissues. From a comparison of developmental processes and gene expression patterns of pituitary-related genes between the agnathan species, lampreys and gnathostomes, we speculate on the evolutionary pathway of the vertebrate adenohypophysis. In the lamprey, this is derived from the nasohypophysial placode (NHP) that develops anterior to the oral ectoderm. The NHP can be identified by the expression of LjPitxA, before actual histogenesis, but it is initially distant from the future hypothalamic region. Subsequently, the NHP expresses both LjFgf8/17 and LjBmp2/4a gene transcripts, and grows caudally to establish a de novo contact with the hypothalamic region by the mid-pharyngula stage. Later, the NHP gives rise to both the adenohypophysis and an unpaired nasal organ. Thus, the topographical relationship between the NHP and the hypothalamic region is established secondarily in the lamprey, unlike gnathostomes in which the equivalent relationship appears early in development. Comparing the developmental pattern of the amphioxus homologue of the adenohypophysis, we hypothesize that a modification of the regulation of the growth factor encoding gene lies behind the evolutionary changes recognized as heterochrony and heterotopy, which leads to the gnathostome hypophysial developmental pattern.

No and Why Not,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,"In a recent article in this journal, Alexander Vargas presents a new, epigenetic explanation of Paul Kammerer's controversial midwife toad experiments, but he has constructed his model without first reading Kammerer's original articles. A look at the articles shows that Vargas is seriously misinformed about what Kammerer did and what the results even were. His model simply cannot explain the results as they were originally reported and it cannot easily be corrected. Similarly, Vargas historical inferences about the Kammerer affair, Kammerer's priority for the discovery of parent-of-origin effects, and the negative reactions of geneticists to this purported discovery, are unsupported and do not stand up to scrutiny.

44,N,Divergent genetic and epigenetic post-zygotic isolation mechanisms in Mus and Peromyscus,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Interspecific hybridization in the rodent genera Peromyscus and Mus results in abnormal placentation. In the Peromyscus interspecies hybrids, abnormal allelic interaction between an X-linked locus and the imprinted paternally expressed Peg3 locus was shown to cause the placental defects. In addition, loss-of-imprinting (LOI) of Peg3 was positively correlated with increased placental size. As in extreme cases this placental dysplasia constitutes a post-zygotic barrier against interspecies hybridization, this finding was the first direct proof that imprinted genes may be important in speciation and thus in evolution. In the Mus interspecies hybrids, a strong role of an X-linked locus in placental dysplasia has also been detected. However, here we show by backcross and allele specific expression analyses that neither LOI of Peg3 nor abnormal interactions between Peg3 and an X-linked locus are involved in generating placental dysplasia in Mus hybrids, although the placental phenotypes observed in the two genera seem to be identical. In contrast to this, another dysgenesis effect common to Peromyscus and Mus hybrids, altered foetal growth, is caused at least in part by the same X-chromosomal regions in both genera. These findings first underline the strong involvement of the X-chromosome in the genetics of speciation. Secondly, they indicate that disruption of epigenetic states, such as LOI, at specific loci may be involved in hybrid dysgenesis effects in one group, but not in another. Thus, we conclude that even in closely related groups divergent molecular mechanisms may be involved in the production of phenotypically similar post-zygotic barriers against hybridization.",2004,17,453-460,10.1046/j.1420-9101.2003.00656.x
45,N,DNA methylation and mycoplasma genomes,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,"DNA methylation is one of the many hypotheses proposed to explain the observed deficiency in CpG dinucleotides in a variety of genomes covering a wide taxonomic distribution. Recent studies challenged the methylation hypothesis on empirical grounds. First, it cannot explain why the Mycoplasma genitalium genome exhibits strong CpG deficiency without DNA methylation. Second, it cannot explain the great variation in CpG deficiency between M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae that also does not have CpG-specific methyltransferase genes. I analyzed the genomic sequences of these Mycoplasma species together with the recently sequenced genomes of M. pulmonis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Staphylococcus aureus, and found the results fully compatible with the methylation hypothesis. In particular, I present compelling empirical evidence to support the following scenario. The common ancestor of the three Mycoplasma species has CpG-specific methyltransferases, and has evolved strong CpG deficiency as a result of the specific DNA methylation. Subsequently, this ancestral genome diverged into M. pulmonis and the common ancestor of M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium. M. pulmonis has retained methyltransferases and exhibits the strongest CpG deficiency. The common ancestor lost the methyltransferase gene and then diverged into M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae. M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae, after losing methylation activities, began to regain CpG dinucleotides through random mutation. M. genitalium evolved more slowly than M. pneumoniae, gained relatively fewer CpG dinucleotides, and is more CpG-deficient.",2003,57,S21-S28,10.1007/s00239-003-0003-6
46,N,"Dynamic changes of histone acetylation and methylation in bovine oocytes, zygotes, and preimplantation embryos",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,"Histone modifications play important roles in regulating chromatin dynamic changes. In this study, acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 and 18 (H3K9ac and H3K18ac), acetylated histone H4 lysine 5 and 8 (H4K5ac and H4K8ac), tri-methylation histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), di-methylation histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) are investigated in bovine oocytes, zygote, and preimplantation. During meiosis, H3K9ac and H3K18ac are erased after germinal vesicle breakdown, H4K8ac is erased after metaphase I (MI). Although H4K5ac is erased at MI, it is redetectable after this stage. However, histone methylations have no significant change during meiosis. During fertilization, intensive H4K5ac and H4K8ac are resumed on male and female chromatins at postfertilization 4 and 8 hr, respectively. H3K9ac and H3K18ac are resumed on both male and female chromatins at postfertilization 8 and 12 hr, respectively. H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 gradually increased on male chromatin after postfertilization 8 hr, while these two signals on female chromatin are detectable from postfertilization 2-18 hr. During embryo cleavage, H3K9ac, H3K18ac, and H3K4me3 are reduced at 8-cell stage, and then start to increase. H4K5ac, H4K8ac, and H3K9me2 increase after the 4-cell stage. At interphase, H4K5ac and H4K8ac are more intensive in nuclear periphery from 2- to 8-cell stages. During mitosis, the signal of H4K8ac is intensive at chromosome periphery. In summary, during both oocyte meiosis and fertilization, the dynamic changes of both histone acetylations and methylations happen in a process of lysine residue-specific and species-specific. During preimplantation development, the dynamic patterns of both H3K9ac and H3K18ac are similar to that of H3K4me3, while the dynamic pattern of H4K5ac is similar to that of H4K8ac. These results will be helpful for understanding the effect of histone posttranslational modifications on bovine reproduction and development.",2020,334,245-256,10.1002/jez.b.22943

The precise inheritance of dispersal, however, is to date largely unknown in many organisms, thereby hampering any progress in evaluating the adaptive potential of species during range expansion. Using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, we therefore empirically simulated spatial sorting by means of artificial selection on a unique pre-dispersal behaviour, tightly related to emigration. To separate directionality of the response from potential drift, we mimicked a recurrent low number of founders in replicated selection regimes. Afterwards, we inferred the mode of inheritance of the pre-dispersal behaviour by performing reciprocal crosses between selected (i.e. dispersive) and non-selected (i.e. non-dispersive) mites and by screening for endosymbionts known to be associated with changes in dispersal behaviour. Despite the recurrent low number of founders, the aerial dispersal behaviour responded strongly to the imposed selection pressure. The behaviour furthermore showed a maternal inheritance, though independent of any known dispersal-related endosymbionts. Though cytoplasmic inheritance cannot fully be excluded, we attribute the observed strong and rapid, maternally influenced response in dispersal to transgenerational epigenetic effects. Consequently, we can expect fast evolutionary dynamics during range expansion in the species.",2015,29,299-310,10.1007/s10682-015-9756-9

Nevertheless, epigenetics has not yet found broad appreciation in one of the most exciting fields of biology: the comprehension of evolution. This is surprising, since the reason for the existence of this alternative information-transmitting system lies certainly in the evolutionary advantage it provides. Theoretical considerations support a model in which epigenetic mechanisms allow for increasing phenotypic variability and permit populations to explore the adaptive landscape without modifications of the genotype. The data presented here support the view that modulating the epigenotype of the human bloodfluke Schistosoma mansoni by treatment of larvae with histone deacetylase inhibitor leads indeed to an increase of phenotypic variability. It is therefore conceivable that environmentally induced changes in the epigenotype release new phenotypes on which selection can act and that this process is the first step in adaptive evolution.",2010,119,669-678,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18040.x

54,N,Epigenetic effects of infection on the phenotype of host offspring: parasites reaching across host generations,OIKOS,"Parasite-induced changes in host phenotype are now well-documented from a wide range of taxa. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that parasites can also have trans-generational consequences, with infection of a host leading to changes in the phenotype of its offspring, though the latter are not parasitised. Several proximate mechanisms have been put forward to explain these 'maternal' effects, most involving hormonal or other physiological pathways, ultimately leading to offspring that are pre-adapted to the parasites they are most likely to encounter based on their mother's experience. Here, we propose that all these trans-generational effects on offspring phenotype must involve epigenetic phenomena. Epigenetics concerns the appearance and inheritance of seemingly new phenotypic traits without changes in the underlying DNA sequence. Since diet and other environmental factors experienced by a mother can affect gene expression in her offspring by turning genes 'on' or 'off' (for example, via DNA methylation), why couldn't parasites do it? Although epigenetic effects have not been explicitly invoked to account for trans-generational impacts of parasites on the phenotype of host offspring, the existing evidence is fully compatible with their involvement. We argue that epigenetic mechanisms must play a central role; we also discuss their evolutionary implications and suggest questions for future investigations in this new and exciting research direction.",2008,117,331-335,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16435.x
55,N,Epigenetic Effects on Integration of Limb Lengths in a Mouse Model: Selective Breeding for High Voluntary Locomotor Activity,EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Mammals exhibit a similar pattern of integration among homologous limb elements, the strength of which is believed to vary in response to selection for functional coordination or similarity. Although integration is hypothesized to primarily reflect the effect of genes intrinsic to limbs, extrinsic genetic or epigenetic factors may also affect the strength of integration through their impact on the magnitude and direction of skeletal variance or covariance. Such factors as neuromuscular coordination or bone-muscle interactions may therefore play a role in both canalization and the structure or magnitude of limb integration. If this were the case, then increased levels of locomotor activity would be predicted to increase canalization and the magnitude of covariation between limbs. To investigate whether postnatal activity levels can have a significant effect on variance within or covariance among homologous limb elements, we compared four groups of male mice from a long-term selective breeding experiment: (1) mice from lines bred for increased voluntary activity on running wheels and allowed free access to a wheel for 8 weeks beginning at weaning (active), (2) selected mice that did not have wheel access (sedentary), (3) active mice from non-selected control lines, and (4) sedentary control mice. Mice from selected lines that had wheel access ran significantly more than control-line mice. However, when controlled for activity, linetype, and body mass, results indicate few significant differences in means, variance, or covariation structure, and no significant differences in integration between limbs, suggesting that postnatal activity levels do not significantly affect canalization or integration of limb lengths. A possible explanation for this result is that whereas baseline levels of postnatal activity may help to maintain patterns of variance and integration, increased levels of activity do not further increase these measures. Investigations into disrupted epigenetic processes (e.g., via models in which neuromuscular coordination is impaired) are required to further test hypotheses about how canalization or integration of limb variation is affected by epigenetic factors.",2009,36,88-99,10.1007/s11692-009-9053-z
56,N,Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: The evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a topic of major medical importance. Evolution is the result of natural selection acting on variant phenotypes. Both the rigid base sequence of DNA and the more plastic expression patterns of the genes present define phenotype. Results: We investigated the evolution of resistant E. coli when exposed to low concentrations of antibiotic. We show that within an isogenic population there are heritable variations in gene expression patterns, providing phenotypic diversity for antibiotic selection to act on. We studied resistance to three different antibiotics, ampicillin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid, which act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis and DNA synthesis, respectively. In each case survival rates were too high to be accounted for by spontaneous DNA mutation. In addition, resistance levels could be ramped higher by successive exposures to increasing antibiotic concentrations. Furthermore, reversion rates to antibiotic sensitivity were extremely high, generally over 50%, consistent with an epigenetic inheritance mode of resistance. The gene expression patterns of the antibiotic resistant E. coli were characterized with microarrays. Candidate genes, whose altered expression might confer survival, were tested by driving constitutive overexpression and determining antibiotic resistance. Three categories of resistance genes were identified. The endogenous beta-lactamase gene represented a cryptic gene, normally inactive, but when by chance expressed capable of providing potent ampicillin resistance. The glutamate decarboxylase gene, in contrast, is normally expressed, but when overexpressed has the incidental capacity to give an increase in ampicillin resistance. And the DAM methylase gene is capable of regulating the expression of other genes, including multidrug efflux pumps. Conclusion: In this report we describe the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria mediated by the epigenetic inheritance of variant gene expression patterns. This provides proof in principle that epigenetic inheritance, as well as DNA mutation, can drive evolution.",2008,8,52,10.1186/1471-2148-8-52
57,N,Epigenetic interactions and the structure of phenotypic variation in the cranium,EVOLUTION & DEVELOPMENT,"Understanding the developmental and genetic basis for evolutionarily significant morphological variation in complex phenotypes such as the mammalian skull is a challenge because of the sheer complexity of the factors involved. We hypothesize that even in this complex system, the expression of phenotypic variation is structured by the interaction of a few key developmental processes. To test this hypothesis, we created a highly variable sample of crania using four mouse mutants and their wild-type controls from similar genetic backgrounds with developmental perturbations to particular cranial regions. Using geometric morphometric methods we compared patterns of size, shape, and integration in the sample within and between the basicranium, neurocranium, and face. The results highlight regular and predictable patterns of covariation among regions of the skull that presumably reflect the epigenetic influences of the genetic perturbations in the sample. Covariation between relative widths of adjoining regions is the most dominant factor, but there are other significant axes of covariation such as the relationship between neurocranial size and basicranial flexion. Although there are other sources of variation related to developmental perturbations not analyzed in this study, the patterns of covariation created by the epigenetic interactions evident in this sample may underlie larger scale evolutionary patterns in mammalian craniofacial form.",2007,9,76-91,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00139.x

We model the effects of epigenetic mutations on the dynamics and endpoints of adaptive walks-a process where a series of beneficial mutations move a population towards a fitness optimum. We use an individual-based model of an asexual population, where mutational effects are drawn from Fisher's geometric model. We find cases where epigenetic mutations speed adaptation or result in populations with higher fitness. However, we also find cases where they slow adaptation or result in populations with lower fitness. The effect of epigenetic mutations on adaptive walks depends crucially on their stability and fitness effects relative to genetic mutations, with small-effect epigenetic mutations generally speeding adaptation, and epigenetic mutations with the same fitness effects as genetic mutations slowing adaptation. Our work reveals a complex relationship between epigenetic mutations and natural selection and highlights the need for empirical data.",2016,25,1856-1868,10.1111/mec.13296
59,N,"Epigenetic randomness, complexity and singularity of human iris patterns",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"We investigated the. randomness and uniqueness of human iris patterns by mathematically comparing 2.3 million different pairs of eve images. The phase structure of each iris pattern was extracted by demodulation with quadrature wavelets spanning several scales of analysis. The resulting distribution of phase sequence variation anion different eyes was precisely binomial, revealing 244 independent degrees of freedom. This amount of statistical variability corresponds to an entropy (information density) of about 3.2 bits mm(-2) over the iris. It implies that the probability of two different irides agreeing by chance in more than 70% of their phase sequence is about one in 7 billion. We also compared images of genetically identical irides, from the left and right eyes of 324 persons, and from monozygotic twins. Their relative phase sequence variation generated the same statistical distribution as did unrelated eyes. This indicates that apart from overall form and colour. iris patterns are determined epigenetically by random events in the morphogenesis of this tissue. The resulting diversity, and the combinatorial complexity created by so many dimensions of random variation, mean that the failure of a simple test of statistical independence performed on iris patterns can serve as a reliable rapid basis for automatic personal identification.",2001,268,1737-1740,10.1098 spb.2001.1696

Evidence from various biological systems indicates the interdependency between the genomes, which requires a high degree of compatibility and synchrony to ensure effective cellular function throughout development and in the resultant offspring. During development, waves of DNA demethylation, de novo methylation, and maintenance methylation act on the nuclear genome and typify oogenesis and pre- and postimplantation development. At the same time, significant changes in mitochondrial DNA copy number influence the metabolic status of the developing organism in a typically cell-type-specific manner. Collectively, at any given stage in development, these actions establish genomic balance that ensures each developmental milestone is met and that the organism's program for life is established.",2021,9,203-224,10.1146/annurev-animal-080520-083353
62,N,"Epigenetic regulation of trophic morphology through feeding behaviour in Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus",BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,"Several models of speciation suggest that in species that are phenotypically plastic, selection can act on phenotypic variation that is environmentally induced in the earliest stages of divergence. One trait that could be subject to this process is foraging behaviour, where discrete foraging strategies are common. One species which is highly plastic in the expression of phenotype, the Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), is characterized by discrete variation in the anatomy of the head and mouthparts. These traits have been shown to have a functional significance, but the expression of which is thought to be at least partly phenotypically plastic. Here we test the hypothesis that foraging behaviour may regulate the anatomy of the head and mouthparts in Arctic charr. In a dyad experiment, size-matched pairs of fish from a mixed family group were fed a diet of either Mysis (a hard-bodied shrimp) or Chironomid larvae. Nine morphometric measures of head dimensions that describe wild trophic morphs were measured at the start of the experiment and 24 weeks later. Principal component scores of size-corrected morphometric measures showed highly significant differences between fish exposed to the two diets. Univariate ANOVA analysis of the head morphometric variables showed that fish fed on Chironomids developed longer, wider jaws, longer heads and a larger eye for a given body length than did those fish fed upon Mysis. We conclude that foraging anatomy in Arctic charr is phenotypically plastic and that variation in foraging behaviour that results in feeding specialization in the wild could induce variation in head anatomy. This in turn could reinforce foraging specialization. Very rapid epigenetic divergence into distinct feeding morphs (as demonstrated here) would allow selection to act at more than one mode and thus could promote rapid evolutionary divergence, initially prior to genetic segregation, in species which are highly plastic.

63,N,Epigenetic silencing may aid evolution by gene duplication,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,"Gene duplication is commonly regarded as the main evolutionary path toward the gain of a new function. However, even with gene duplication, there is a loss-versus-gain dilemma: most newly born duplicates degrade to pseudogenes, since degenerative mutations are much more frequent than advantageous ones. Thus, something additional seems to be needed to shift the loss versus gain equilibrium toward functional divergence. We suggest that epigenetic silencing of duplicates might play this role in evolution. This study began when we noticed in a previous publication (Lynch M, Conery JS [2000] Science 291:1151-1155) that the frequency of functional young gene duplicates is higher in organisms that have cytosine methylation (H. sapiens, M. musculus, and A. thaliana) than in organisms that do not have methylated genomes (S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans). We find that genome data analysis confirms the likelihood of much more efficient functional divergence of gene duplicates in mammals and plants than in yeast, nematode, and fly. We have also extended the classic model of gene duplication, in which newly duplicated genes have exactly the same expression pattern, to the case when they are epigenetically silenced in a tissue- and/or developmental stage-complementary manner. This exposes each of the duplicates to negative selection, thus protecting from pseudogenization. Our analysis indicates that this kind of silencing (i) enhances evolution of duplicated genes to new functions, particularly in small populations, (ii) is quite consistent with the subfunctionalization model when degenerative but complementary mutations affect different subfunctions of the gene, and (iii) furthermore, may actually cooperate with the DDC (duplication-degeneration-complementation) process.",2003,56,718-729,10.1007/s00239-002-2446-6

65,N,EPIGENETIC VARIATION IN ASEXUALLY REPRODUCING ORGANISMS,EVOLUTION,"The role that epigenetic inheritance can play in adaptation may differ between sexuals and asexuals because (1) the dynamics of adaptation differ under sexual and asexual reproduction and the opportunities offered by epigenetic inheritance may affect these dynamics differently; and (2) in asexual reproduction epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms that are associated with meiosis can be bypassed, which could promote the buildup of epigenetic variation in asexuals. Here, we evaluate current evidence for an epigenetic contribution to adaptation in asexuals. We argue that two aspects of epigenetic variation should have particular relevance for asexuals, namely epigenetics-mediated phenotypic plasticity within and between generations, and heritable variation via stochastic epimutations. An evaluation of epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms suggests that some, but not all, forms of asexual reproduction enhance the likelihood of stable transmission of epigenetic marks across generations compared to sexual reproduction. However, direct tests of these predicted sexual-asexual differences are virtually lacking. Stable transmission of DNA methylation, transcriptomes, and phenotypes from parent to clonal offspring are demonstrated in various asexual species, and clonal genotypes from natural populations show habitat-specific DNA methylation. We discuss how these initial observations can be extended to demonstrate an epigenetic contribution to adaptation.",2014,68,644-655,10.1111/evo.12320
66,N,Evolution of DNA-methylation machinery: DNA methyltransferases and methyl-DNA binding proteins in the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae,DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with gene regulation and cell memory, silencing of transposable elements, genomic imprinting, and repression of spurious transcription of duplicated sequences. These roles have varied widely during animal evolution and current functions depend on the specific methylation pattern of the species under consideration. The patterns of methylation are established, maintained, and translated into appropriate functional states by the DNA-methylation machinery, which includes three groups of methyltransferase enzymes, Dnmt1, Dnmt2 and Dnmt3, and five methyl-DNA binding proteins, Mbd1, Mbd2, Mbd3, Mbd4, and MeCP2. In this study, I have identified the members of the Dnmt and the Mbd gene families in the cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), the most basal extant chordate and one of the closest sister groups of vertebrates. Database searches, phylogenetic studies and protein domain analyses revealed the presence of the three major groups of Dnmt enzymes in the cephalochordate genome, whereas only two Mbd members, Mbd2/3 and Mbd4, were found. Analysis of the amphioxus methylation machinery suggested that the complexity and the structural organization of cephalochordate methyltransferases do not differ substantially from those of current vertebrate enzymes, while new Mbd proteins arose in vertebrates, which perhaps minimized certain collateral effects associated with the major genomic changes that occurred during the invertebrate-vertebrate transition.",2008,218,691-701,10.1007/s00427-008-0247-7

Multiple copies of Fot1 were sequenced from each strain in which the element occurs. In three species. the Fot1 nucleotide sequence is 98% identical to that from F. oxysporum (Fox), whereas nucleotide divergence for host genes is markedly higher: 11% for partial nuclear 28S rDNA and up to 30% for the gene encoding nitrate reductase (nia). In two species, sequence divergence of Fot1-related elements relative to Fox ranged from 7% to 23% (16% average). Most of the sequence differences (82%) were C-to-T and G-to-A transitions. These mutations are distributed throughout the Fot1 sequences, although they tend to be concentrated in the middle portion of the elements. Analysis of the local sequence context of transitions revealed a hierarchy of site preferences. These characteristics are typical of the repeat-induced point mutation process. first discovered in Neurospora crassa. The spotty distribution of Fot1 elements among species together with the high degree of similarity between Fot1 sequences present in distant species strongly suggests a case of horizontal transfer.",2002,19,510-520,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004106

69,N,Experimental alteration of DNA methylation affects the phenotypic plasticity of ecologically relevant traits in Arabidopsis thaliana,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"Heritable phenotypic variation in plants can be caused not only by underlying genetic differences, but also by variation in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. However, we still know very little about how relevant such epigenetic variation is to the ecology and evolution of natural populations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we treated a set of natural genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and examined the consequences of this treatment for plant traits and their phenotypic plasticity. Experimental demethylation strongly reduced the growth and fitness of plants and delayed their flowering, but the degree of this response varied significantly among genotypes. Differences in genotypes' responses to demethylation were only weakly related to their genetic relatedness, which is consistent with the idea that natural epigenetic variation is independent of genetic variation. Demethylation also altered patterns of phenotypic plasticity, as well as the amount of phenotypic variation observed among plant individuals and genotype means. We have demonstrated that epigenetic variation can have a dramatic impact on ecologically important plant traits and their variability, as well as on the fitness of plants and their ecological interactions. Epigenetic variation may thus be an overlooked factor in the evolutionary ecology of plant populations.",2010,24,541-553,10.1007/s10682-010-9372-7
70,N,Exploring epiallele stability in a population-epigenetic model,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,"Differences in transgenerational epigenetic stability can result in a diversity of phenotypes among genetically identical individuals. Here we present a model that encapsulates non-genomic phenotypic variation in a population over two distinct environments that each act as a stimulus for epigenetic modification. By allowing different levels of epigenetic resetting, thereby increasing epigenetic diversity, we explore the dynamics of multiple epiallelic states subject to selection in a population-epigenetic model. We find that both epigenetic resetting and the environmental frequency are crucial parameters in this system. Our results illustrate the regions of parameter space that enable up to three equilibria to be simultaneously locally stable. Furthermore, it is clear that both continued environmental induction and epigenetic resetting prevent epigenetic fixation, maintaining phenotypic variation through different epiallelic states. However, unless both environments are reasonably common, levels of epigenetically-maintained variation are low. We argue that it is vital that non-genomic phenotypic diversity is not ignored in evolutionary theory, but instead regarded as distinct epiallelic variants. Ultimately, a critical goal of future experiments should be to determine accurate rates of epigenetic resetting, especially over several generations, in order to establish the long-term significance of epigenetic inheritance.

It is often useful to think of developmental systems as integrating available sources of information about current conditions to produce organisms. Genes and inherited physiology provide cues, as does the state of the environment during development. The integration systems themselves are under genetic control and subject to Darwinian selection, so we expect them to evolve to produce organisms that fit well with current ecological (including social) conditions. We argue for the scientific value of this explicitly informational perspective by providing detailed examples of how it can elucidate taxonomically diverse phenomena. We also present a general framework for linking genetic and phenotypic variation from an informational perspective. This application of Darwinian logic at the organismal level can elucidate genetic influences on phenotypic variation in novel and counterintuitive ways.",2015,30,327-333,10.1016/j.tree.2015.04.002
72,N,Genetic and epigenetic alterations after hybridization and genome doubling,TAXON,"Hvbridization and polyploidization are now recognized as major phenomena in the evolution of plants, promoting,Q genetic diversity, adaptive radiation and speciation. Modern molecular techniques have recently provided evidence that allopolyploidy can induce several types of genetic and epigenetic events that are of critical importance for the evolutionary success of these plants: (1) chromosomal rearrangements within one or both parental genomes contribute toward proper meiotic pairing and isolation of the hybrid from its progenitors; (2) demethylation and activation of dormant transposable elements may trigger insertional mutagenesis and changes in local patterns of gene expression, facilitating rapid genomic reorganization; (3) rapid and reproducible loss of low copy DNA sequences appears to result in further differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes; and (4) organ-specific up- or down-regulation of one of the duplicated genes, may result in unequal expression or silencing one copy. All these alterations also have the potential, while stabilizing allopolyploid genomes, to produce novel expression patterns and new phenotypes, which together with increased heterozygosity and gene redundancy might confer on allopolyploids an elevated evolutionary potential, with effects at scales ranging from molecular to ecological. Although important advances have been rnade in understanding genomic responses to allopolyploidization, further insights are still expected to be gained in the near future, Such as the direction and nature of the diploidization process, functional relevance of gene expression alterations, molecular mechanisms that result in adaptation to different ecologies/habitats, and ecological and evolutionary implications of recurrent polyploidization.",2007,56,649-656,10.2307/25065849

Here we report expression and epigenetic changes in a chromosomal region containing the MIR172b locus in the allotetraploids. Although mature miRNA sequences are conserved, A. thaliana and A. arenosa miRNA loci diverge rapidly in sequence and expression. Among four MIR172 loci in Arabidopsis, the level of nucleotide sequence divergence between A. thaliana and A. arenosa MIR172 loci is 15-25%, which is higher than that of protein-coding genes (similar to 5%). MIR172b locus and its flanking genes in A. arenosa were expressed at low levels relative to that in A. thaliana, which is associated with hypermethylation of this region in the allotetraploids. Consistently with this notion, pri-miR172 transcripts in the allotetraploids were primarily derived from the A. thaliana MIR172b locus. Expression of homoeologous alleles in miR172 target loci is associated with allelic loss, allelic changes in outcrossing A. arenosa or repression of A. thaliana alleles. These data suggest that gene expression changes in this homoeologous region are associated with genetic diversity and epigenetic variation of miRNA genes and their targets in allopolyploids.",2014,112,207-214,10.1038/hdy.2013.94
74,N,Genetic and epigenetic reprogramming of the wheat genome upon allopolyploidization,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,"In the past few years we have analysed alterations in genome structure and expression that occur in wheat upon allopolyploidization. Our major findings in natural and synthetic allopolyploid wheat are reviewed here. It was found that allopolyploidization brings about rapid genome evolution through the instantaneous generation of a variety of cardinal genetic and epigenetic alterations comprising: (1) non-random elimination of coding and non-coding DNA sequences, (2) epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation of coding and non-coding DNA leading, among others, to gene silencing, and (3) activation of retroelements, which in turn alters the expression of adjacent genes. These changes were reproducible, occurring in the F1 hybrids or in the first generation(s) of a series of nascent allopolyploids corresponding to various interspecific and intergeneric combinations. Moreover, these changes were similar to those that occurred twice in nature: first, at the transition from diploid to tetraploid wheat (similar to0.5 Mya) and, second, at the transition from tetraploid to hexaploid wheat (similar to9500 years ago). Elimination of non-coding sequences augments the differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes at the polyploid level, thus increasing the physical divergence between homoeologues and contributing to the diploid-like meiotic behaviour of polyploid wheat. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations of gene activity, including transcriptional activation of retroelements, led to novel expression patterns. These phenomena emphasize the plasticity of the genome with regard to both structure and gene expression. This plasticity in turn might improve the adaptability of the newly formed allopolyploids and facilitate their rapid and successful establishment in nature.

78,N,Genomic potential for arsenic efflux and methylation varies among global Prochlorococcus populations,ISME JOURNAL,"The globally significant picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the main primary producer in oligotrophic subtropical gyres. When phosphate concentrations are very low in the marine environment, the mol: mol availability of phosphate relative to the chemically similar arsenate molecule is reduced, potentially resulting in increased cellular arsenic exposure. To mediate accidental arsenate uptake, some Prochlorococcus isolates contain genes encoding a full or partial efflux detoxification pathway, consisting of an arsenate reductase (arsC), an arsenite-specific efflux pump (acr3) and an arsenic-related repressive regulator (arsR). This efflux pathway was the only previously known arsenic detox pathway in Prochlorococcus. We have identified an additional putative arsenic mediation strategy in Prochlorococcus driven by the enzyme arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) which can convert inorganic arsenic into more innocuous organic forms and appears to be a more widespread mode of detoxification. We used a phylogenetically informed approach to identify Prochlorococcus linked arsenic genes from both pathways in the Global Ocean Sampling survey. The putative arsenic methylation pathway is nearly ubiquitously present in global Prochlorococcus populations. In contrast, the complete efflux pathway is only maintained in populations which experience extremely low PO4:AsO4, such as regions in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic. Thus, environmental exposure to arsenic appears to select for maintenance of the efflux detoxification pathway in Prochlorococcus. The differential distribution of these two pathways has implications for global arsenic cycling, as their associated end products, arsenite or organoarsenicals, have differing biochemical activities and residence times.",2016,10,197-209,10.1038/ismej.2015.85

How these abilities were acquired remains an outstanding question in protistan biology. Results: In this work, we study SET domain bearing genes that are implicated in mediating immune evasion, invasion and cytoadhesion pathways of modern apicomplexans, including malaria parasites. We provide the first conclusive evidence of a horizontal gene transfer of a Histone H4 Lysine 20 (H4K20) modifier, Set8, from an animal host to the ancestor of apicomplexans. Set8 is known to contribute to the coordinated expression of genes involved in immune evasion in modern apicomplexans. We also show the likely transfer of a H3K36 methyltransferase (Ashr3 from plants), possibly derived from algal endosymbionts. These transfers appear to date to the transition from free-living organisms to parasitism and coincide with the proposed horizontal acquisition of cytoadhesion domains, the O-glycosyltransferase that modifies these domains, and the primary family of transcription factors found in apicomplexan parasites. Notably, phylogenetic support for these conclusions is robust and the genes clearly are dissimilar to SET sequences found in the closely related parasite Perkinsus marinus, and in ciliates, the nearest free-living organisms with complete genome sequences available. Conclusions: Animal and plant sources of epigenetic machinery provide new insights into the evolution of parasitism in apicomplexans. Along with the horizontal transfer of cytoadhesive domains, O-linked glycosylation and key transcription factors, the acquisition of SET domain methyltransferases marks a key transitional event in the evolution to parasitism in this important protozoan lineage.",2013,13,37,10.1186/1471-2148-13-37
81,N,"HOW SOME ALIEN SPECIES BECOME INVASIVE. SOME ECOLOGICAL, GENETIC AND EPIGENETIC BASIS FOR BIOINVASIONS",INTERCIENCIA,"Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors determine that some exotic species invade and become established, whereas most apparently either fails to become established or persist as small, isolated populations. To understand invasions we analyze different kinds of mechanisms that would allow the introduced organisms to become invasive in their new environments: enemy release, allelopathy, Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, empty niches, propagule pressure, breakdown of biotic regulation, phenotypic plasticity, variation increase (by means of hybridization, genome and gene duplication, endosymbiosis, transposition, somatic mutations and mitotic recombinations, small regulatory RNAs), purge; adaptive mutations; and epigenetic changes. These processes are key to explain the success of some alien species in new environments.",2012,37,238-244,
82,N,HOW STABLE 'SHOULD' EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS BE? INSIGHTS FROM ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY AND BET HEDGING,EVOLUTION,"Although there is keen interest in the potential adaptive value of epigenetic variation, it is unclear what conditions favor the stability of these variants either within or across generations. Because epigenetic modifications can be environmentally sensitive, existing theory on adaptive phenotypic plasticity provides relevant insights. Our consideration of this theory suggests that stable maintenance of environmentally induced epigenetic states over an organism's lifetime is most likely to be favored when the organism accurately responds to a single environmental change that subsequently remains constant, or when the environmental change cues an irreversible developmental transition. Stable transmission of adaptive epigenetic states from parents to offspring may be selectively favored when environments vary across generations and the parental environment predicts the offspring environment. The adaptive value of stability beyond a single generation of parent-offspring transmission likely depends on the costs of epigenetic resetting. Epigenetic stability both within and across generations will also depend on the degree and predictability of environmental variation, dispersal patterns, and the (epi)genetic architecture underlying phenotypic responses to environment. We also discuss conditions that favor stability of random epigenetic variants within the context of bet hedging. We conclude by proposing research directions to clarify the adaptive significance of epigenetic stability.",2014,68,632-643,10.1111/evo.12324
83,N,Insect small non-coding RNA involved in epigenetic regulations,CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE,"Small regulatory RNAs can not only guide post-transcriptional repression of target genes, but some of them can also direct heterochromatin formation of specific genomic loci. Here we review the published literature on small RNA-guided epigenetic regulation in insects. The recent development of novel analytical technologies (deep sequencing and RNAi screens) has led to the identification of some of the factors involved in these processes, as well as their molecular mechanism and subcellular localization. Other findings uncovered an additional mode of epigenetic control, where maternally inherited small RNAs can affect phenotypes in a stable, transgenerational manner. The evolutive history of small RNA effector proteins in insects suggests that these two modes of regulation are variably conserved among species.",2014,1,9-Jan,10.1016/j.cois.2014.05.001
84,N,Insecticide resistance in the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer): chromosome location and epigenetic effects on esterase gene expression in clonal lineages,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,"Insecticide treatment of the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) has led to the evolution of several insecticide resistance mechanisms, including the detoxification of insecticides by elevated esterases. This results from amplification of one of two closely related esterase genes (E4 or FE4) with up to 80 copies in the most resistant aphids. The amplified E4 genes are at a single site linked to a chromosomal translocation and resistance can be unstable. Individuals within a clone lose their elevated esterase and resistant phenotype, a good example of 'clonal variation'. This loss of esterase is accompanied by a loss of the corresponding mRNA but the amplified genes are retained with no detectable sequence differences. However, the expressed E4 genes contain 5-methylcytosine, which is lost at the same time as the genes are turned off. This is in direct contrast with vertebrate genes where DNA methylation causes gene silencing, but it does suggest that the resistant phenotype in M. persicae is under epigenetic control. One hypothesis is that 5-methylcytosine in E4 genes facilitates expression by preventing the production of incorrectly initiated transcripts. It is interesting that we have never detected silencing of amplified FE4 genes, possibly because they are at multiple loci and therefore less likely to be subject to synchronous control.

85,N,Interpreting phenotypic antibiotic tolerance and persister cells as evolution via epigenetic inheritance,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Epigenetic inheritance is the transmission of nongenetic material such as gene expression levels, RNA and other biomolecules from parents to offspring. There is a growing realization that such forms of inheritance can play an important role in evolution. Bacteria represent a prime example of epigenetic inheritance because a large array of cellular components is transmitted to offspring, in addition to genetic material. Interestingly, there is an extensive and growing empirical literature showing that many bacteria can form 'persister' cells that are phenotypically resistant or tolerant to antibiotics, but most of these results are not interpreted within the context of epigenetic inheritance. Instead, persister cells are usually viewed as a genetically encoded bet-hedging strategy that has evolved in response to a fluctuating environment. Here I show, using a relatively simple model, that many of these empirical findings can be more simply understood as arising from a combination of epigenetic inheritance and cellular noise. I therefore suggest that phenotypic drug tolerance in bacteria might represent one of the best-studied examples of evolution under epigenetic inheritance.",2016,25,1869-1882,10.1111/mec.13603

Methylation appears to play a central role in shaping the developmental processes that give rise to the different castes. However, could DNA methylation have other roles in social insects? Theoretical arguments predict that male and female hymenopterans can be in conflict over the reproductive potential of their female offspring. An exciting prospect for future research is to examine the possibility that queens and males imprint the genomes of their gametes using DNA methylation to manipulate the reproductive potential of their progeny in ways that favour the inclusive fitness of the parent.",2012,27,367-373,10.1016/j.tree.2012.02.005
87,N,Landscape of Fluid Sets of Hairpin-Derived 21-/24-nt-Long Small RNAs at Seed Set Uncovers Special Epigenetic Features in Picea glauca,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Conifers' exceptionally large genome (20-30 Gb) is scattered with 60% retrotransposon (RT) components and we have little knowledge on their origin and evolutionary implications. RTs may impede the expression of flanking genes and provide sources of the formation of novel small RNA (sRNAs) populations to constrain events of transposon (TE) proliferation/transposition. Here we show a declining expression of 24-nt-long sRNAs and low expression levels of their key processing gene, pgRTL2 (RNASE THREE LIKE 2) at seed set in Picea glauca. The sRNAs in 24-nt size class are significantly less enriched in type and read number than 21-nt sRNAs and have not been documented in other species. The architecture of MIR loci generating highly expressed 24-/21-nt sRNAs is featured by long terminal repeat-retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) in families of Ty3/Gypsy and Ty1/Copia elements. This implies that the production of sRNAs may be predominantly originated from TE fragments on chromosomes. Furthermore, a large proportion of highly expressed 24-nt sRNAs does not have predictable targets against unique genes in Picea, suggestive of their potential pathway in DNA methylation modifications on, for instance, TEs. Additionally, the classification of computationally predicted sRNAs suggests that 24-nt sRNA targets may bear particular functions inmetabolic processes while 21-nt sRNAs target genes involved inmany different biological processes. This study, therefore, directs our attention to a possible extrapolation that lacking of 24-nt sRNAs at the late conifer seed developmental phase may result in less constraints in TE activities, thus contributing to the massive expansion of genome size.",2017,9,82-92,10.1093/gbe/evw283

The two phases differ extensively in appearance, behaviour and physiology. We found that solitarious and gregarious locusts have clear differences in their hearing, both in their tympanal and neuronal responses. We identified significant differences in the shape of the tympana that may be responsible for the variations in hearing between locust phases. We measured the nanometre mechanical responses of the ear's tympanal membrane to sound, finding that solitarious animals exhibit greater displacement. Finally, neural experiments signified that solitarious locusts have a relatively stronger response to high frequencies. The enhanced response to high-frequency sounds in the nocturnally flying solitarious locusts suggests greater investment in detecting the ultrasonic echolocation calls of bats, to which they are more vulnerable than diurnally active gregarious locusts. This study highlights the importance of epigenetic effects set forth during development and begins to identify how animals are equipped to match their immediate environmental needs.",2014,281,20141693,10.1098 spb.2014.1693
89,N,lolal Is an Evolutionarily New Epigenetic Regulator of dpp Transcription during Dorsal-Ventral Axis Formation,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Secreted ligands in the Dpp/BMP family drive dorsal-ventral (D/V) axis formation in all Bilaterian species. However, maternal factors regulating Dpp/BMP transcription in this process are largely unknown. We identified the BTB domain protein longitudinals lacking-like (lolal) as a modifier of decapentaplegic (dpp) mutations. We show that Lolal is evolutionarily related to the Trithorax group of chromatin regulators and that lolal interacts genetically with the epigenetic factor Trithorax-like during Dpp D/V signaling. Maternally driven Lolal(HA) is found in oocytes and translocates to zygotic nuclei prior to the point at which dpp transcription begins. lolal maternal and zygotic mutant embryos display significant reductions in dpp, pMad, and zerknullt expression, but they are never absent. The data suggest that lolal is required to maintain dpp transcription during D/V patterning. Phylogenetic data revealed that lolal is an evolutionarily new gene present only in insects and crustaceans. We conclude that Lolal is the first maternal protein identified with a role in dpp D/V transcriptional maintenance, that Lolal and the epigenetic protein Trithorax-like are essential for Dpp D/V signaling and that the architecture of the Dpp D/V pathway evolved in the arthropod lineage after the separation from vertebrates via the incorporation of new genes such as lolal.",2016,33,2621-2632,10.1093/molbev/msw132

The samples from Eastern Germany are close to each other geographically, have small epigenetic distances, and can represent one otter population. Other European samples group with each other and can have a common origin of the European otter populations from one refuge in the post-glacial period. The epigenetic distances for the Kamchatka sample have a similar level of distances between the European samples.

91,N,Mammalian Comparative Genomics Reveals Genetic and Epigenetic Features Associated with Genome Reshuffling in Rodentia,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Understanding how mammalian genomes have been reshuffled through structural changes is fundamental to the dynamics of its composition, evolutionary relationships between species and, in the long run, speciation. In this work, we reveal the evolutionary genomic landscape in Rodentia, the most diverse and speciose mammalian order, by whole-genome comparisons of six rodent species and six representative outgroup mammalian species. The reconstruction of the evolutionary breakpoint regions across rodent phylogeny shows an increased rate of genome reshuffling that is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than in other mammalian species here considered. We identified novel lineage and clade-specific breakpoint regions within Rodentia and analyzed their gene content, recombination rates and their relationship with constitutive lamina genomic associated domains, DNase I hypersensitivity sites and chromatin modifications. We detected an accumulation of protein-coding genes in evolutionary breakpoint regions, especially genes implicated in reproduction and pheromone detection and mating. Moreover, we found an association of the evolutionary breakpoint regions with active chromatin state landscapes, most probably related to gene enrichment. Our results have two important implications for understanding the mechanisms that govern and constrain mammalian genome evolution. The first is that the presence of genes related to species-specific phenotypes in evolutionary breakpoint regions reinforces the adaptive value of genome reshuffling. Second, that chromatin conformation, an aspect that has been often overlooked in comparative genomic studies, might play a role in modeling the genomic distribution of evolutionary breakpoints.",2016,8,3703-3717,10.1093/gbe/evw276
92,N,Manipulation of cytosine methylation does not remove latitudinal clines in two invasive goldenrod species in Central Europe,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Invasive species frequently differentiate phenotypically in novel environments within a few generations, often even with limited genetic variation. For the invasive plants Solidago canadensis and S. gigantea, we tested whether such differentiation might have occurred through heritable epigenetic changes in cytosine methylation. In a 2-year common-garden experiment, we grew plants from seeds collected along a latitudinal gradient in their non-native Central European range to test for trait differentiation and whether differentiation disappeared when seeds were treated with the demethylation agent zebularine. Microsatellite markers revealed no population structure along the latitudinal gradient in S. canadensis, but three genetic clusters in S. gigantea. Solidago canadensis showed latitudinal clines in flowering phenology and growth. In S. gigantea, the number of clonal offspring decreased with latitude. Although zebularine had a significant effect on early growth, probably through effects on cytosine methylation, latitudinal clines remained (or even got stronger) in plants raised from seeds treated with zebularine. Thus, our experiment provides no evidence that epigenetic mechanisms by selective cytosine methylation contribute to the observed phenotypic differentiation in invasive goldenrods in Central Europe.",2021,30,222-236,10.1111/mec.15722
93,N,"Mercury methylation in paddy soil: source and distribution of mercury species at a Hg mining area, Guizhou Province, China",BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Rice paddy plantation is the dominant agricultural land use throughout Asia. Rice paddy fields have been identified as important sites for methylmercury (MeHg) production in the terrestrial ecosystem and a primary pathway of MeHg exposure to humans in mercury (Hg) mining areas. We compared the source and distribution of Hg species in different compartments of the rice paddy during a complete rice-growing season at two different typical Hg-contaminated mining sites in Guizhou province, China: an abandoned site with a high Hg concentration in soil but a low concentration in the atmosphere and a current-day artisanal site with a low concentration in soil but a high concentration in the atmosphere. Our results showed that the flux of new Hg to the ecosystem from irrigation and atmospheric deposition was insignificant relative to the pool of old Hg in soil; the dominant source of MeHg to paddy soil is in situ methylation of inorganic Hg (IHg). Elevated MeHg concentrations and the high proportion of Hg as MeHg in paddy water and the surface soil layer at the artisanal site demonstrated active Hg methylation at this site only. We propose that the in situ production of MeHg in paddy water and surface soil is dependent on elevated Hg in the atmosphere and the consequential deposition of new Hg into a low-pH anoxic geochemical system. The absence of depth-dependent variability in the MeHg concentration in soil cores collected from the abandoned Hg mining site, consistent with the low concentration of Hg in the atmosphere and high pH of the paddy water and irrigation water, suggested that net production of MeHg at this site was limited. We propose that the concentration of Hg in ambient air is an indicator for the risk of MeHg accumulation in paddy rice.",2016,13,2429-2440,10.5194/bg-13-2429-2016
94,N,METHYLATION SITES IN ANGIOSPERM GENES,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,"The extent to which CpG dinucleotides were depleted in a large set of angiosperm genes was, on average, very similar to the extent of CpG depletion in total angiosperm genomic DNA and far less than the extent of CpG depletion in vertebrate genes. Gene sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana, a dicotyledonous species with relatively low levels of total 5-methylcytosine, were just as CpG depleted as the angiosperm genes in general. Furthermore, levels of TpG and CpA, the potential deamination mutation products of methylated CpG, were elevated in A. thaliana genes, supporting a high rate of deamination mutation as the cause of the CpG deficiency. Using a method that takes into account the dinucleotide frequencies within each sequence of interest, we calculated the expected frequencies of CpNpG trinucleotides, which are also highly methylated in angiosperm genomes. CpNpG trinucleotides were not extensively enriched or depleted in the angiosperm genes. Two hypotheses could account for our results. Differential depletion of CpG and CpNpG within angiosperm genes and differential depletion of CpG in angiosperm and vertebrate genes could arise from different efficiencies of mismatch repair or from different levels of cytosine methylation in the cell lineages that contribute to germ cells.",1992,34,219-230,10.1007/BF00162971
95,N,Methylation-dependent transition rates are dependent on local sequence lengths and genomic regions,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Recently, Fryxell and Moon (2005) examined methylation-dependent transition rates (5(m)C deamination rates), which were calculated by the difference between the CpG transition and GpC transition rates, using 4,437 transition mutations in CpG or GpC dinucleotides. They concluded that 5(m)C deamination rates were highly dependent on local GC content but not on local sequence lengths over which GC content was calculated or the genomic regions where the mutations occurred. Here, we reexamined these statements by using 292,216 CpG -> TpG/CpA and GpC -> GpT/ApC mutations, an increase of 66 times as much data. Contrary to Fryxell and Moon's conclusions, our analysis indicated that 5(m)C deamination rates in the human genome were dependent on both the local sequence length and the genomic region.

97,N,Modeling Interactions between Transposable Elements and the Plant Epigenetic Response: A Surprising Reliance on Element Retention,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Transposable elements (TEs) compose the majority of angiosperm DNA. Plants counteract TE activity by silencing them epigenetically. One form of epigenetic silencing requires 21-22 nt small interfering RNAs that act to degrade TE mRNA and may also trigger DNA methylation. DNA methylation is reinforced by a second mechanism, the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. RdDM relies on 24 nt small interfering RNAs and ultimately establishes TEs in a quiescent state. These host factors interact at a systems level, but there have been no system level analyses of their interactions. Here, we define a deterministic model that represents the propagation of active TEs, aspects of the host response and the accumulation of silenced TEs. We describe general properties of the model and also fit it to biological data in order to explore two questions. The first is why two overlapping pathways are maintained, given that both are likely energetically expensive. Under our model, RdDM silenced TEs effectively even when the initiation of silencing was weak. This relationship implies that only a small amount of RNAi is needed to initiate TE silencing, but reinforcement by RdDM is necessary to efficiently counter TE propagation. Second, we investigated the reliance of the host response on rates of TE deletion. The model predicted that low levels of deletion lead to few active TEs, suggesting that silencing is most efficient when methylated TEs are retained in the genome, thereby providing one explanation for the large size of plant genomes.",2018,10,803-815,10.1093/gbe/evy043
98,N,Modeling the impact of DNA methylation on the evolution of BRCA1 in mammals,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The modified base 5-methylcytosine (C-m) plays an important functional role in the biology of mammals as an epigenetic modification and appears to exert a striking impact on the molecular evolution of mammal genomes. The collective epigenetic functions of C-m revolve around its effect on gene transcription, while the influence of this modified base on the evolution of mammal genomes derives from the greatly elevated spontaneous mutation rate of C-m to T. In mammals, C-m occurs at the dinucleotides CpG, CpA, and CpT. As a step toward a comprehensive statistical examination of the role of C-m in mammal molecular evolution, we have developed novel Markov models of codon substitution that incorporate dinucleotide-level terms relevant to C-m mutation. We apply these models to two data sets of aligned BRCA1 exon 11 sequences from bats and primates. In all cases, terms specific to mutations that affect the dinucleotides CpG, CpA, and CpT significantly improved model fit. For the CpG-specific terms, both transition and transversion substitution rates were elevated. These rates differed between the data sets. Bats exhibited a lower relative rate of substitutions at CpG-containing codons. Transition substitutions were significantly less than 1 at CpA-containing codons but greater than 1 at CpT-containing codons. The inclusion of interaction terms in the codon models to represent possible confounding with the effect of natural selection were supported for codons that contained CpG and CpT, but not CpA. From the results, we infer that mutation of C-m is a probable factor that affects BRCA1 codons containing the dinucleotide CpG, a possible factor for CpA-containing codons, and an unlikely factor that affects CpT-containing codons. The confounding of estimated terms with the effect of natural selection indicate this confounding must be addressed for comparisons between different coding and noncoding regions.",2004,21,1760-1768,10.1093/molbev/msh187

The program provides a deep analysis of epigenetic variation starting from a binary data matrix indicating the banding pattern between the isoesquizomeric endonucleases HpaII and MspI, with differential sensitivity to cytosine methylation. After comparing the restriction fragments, the program determines if each fragment is susceptible to methylation (representative of epigenetic variation) or if there is no evidence of methylation (representative of genetic variation).

The effect of the different P/Al ratios on the structures of AlPxO and the influence of AlPxO on the catalytic activity of N-methylation of benzylamine with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) were investigated. The products of N-methylation of dimethyl carbonate with benzylamine were qualitatively analyzed by GC-MS; based on the results of the analysis, the possible pathways of the main products were assumed. The AlPxO samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, NH3-TPD, specific surface area and pore size analysis and TG. Meanwhile, the effect of process conditions on the N-methylation of dimethyl carbonate and benzylamine was investigated. The results have shown that synthesized AlPxO was a more efficient catalyst compared with other molecular sieves. Aluminophosphate molecular sieves of amorphous structure have a higher total selectivity to target amine, which containing the large specific surface area, more acidic sites and the amount of acid. Under the optimal conditions that n(dimethyl carbonate): n(benzylamine) = 1: 1, m(AlP0.9O): m(benzylamine) = 0.06, T = 200 degrees C and t = 4 h, the conversion of benzylamine and the total selectivity of the products from N-methylation of benzylamine were 59.16% and 77.18%, respectively.

102,N,NATURAL VARIATION IN EPIGENETIC GENE REGULATION AND ITS EFFECTS ON PLANT DEVELOPMENTAL TRAITS,EVOLUTION,"In plants, epigenetic variation contributes to phenotypic differences in developmental traits. At the mechanistic level, this variation is conferred by DNA methylation and histone modifications. We describe several examples in which changes in gene expression caused by variation in DNA methylation lead to alterations in plant development. In these examples, the presence of repeated sequences or transposons within the promoters of the affected genes are associated with DNA methylation and gene inactivation. Small interfering RNAs expressed from these sequences recruit DNA methylation to the gene. Some of these methylated alleles are unstable giving rise to revertant sectors during mitosis and to progeny in which the methylated state is lost. However, others are stable for many generations and persist through speciation. These examples indicate that although DNA methylation influences gene expression, this is frequently dependent on classical changes to DNA sequence such as transposon insertions. By contrast, forms of histone methylation cause repression of gene expression that is stably inherited through mitosis but that can also be erased over time or during meiosis. A striking example involves the induction of flowering by exposure to low winter temperatures in Arabidopsis thaliana and its relatives. Histone methylation participates in repression of expression of an inhibitor of flowering during cold. In annual, semelparous species such as A. thaliana, this histone methylation is stably inherited through mitosis after return from cold to warm temperatures allowing the plant to flower continuously during spring and summer until it senesces. However, in perennial, iteroparous relatives the histone modification rapidly disappears when temperatures rise, allowing expression of the floral inhibitor to increase and limiting flowering to a short interval. In this case, epigenetic histone modifications control a key adaptive trait, and their pattern changes rapidly during evolution associated with life-history strategy. We discuss these examples of epigenetic developmental traits with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms, their stability, and adaptive value.",2014,68,620-631,10.1111/evo.12286
103,N,No Evidence That Protein Noise-Induced Epigenetic Epistasis Constrains Gene Expression Evolution,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Changes in gene expression can affect phenotypes and therefore both its level and stochastic variability are frequently under selection. It has recently been proposed that epistatic interactions influence gene expression evolution: gene pairs where simultaneous knockout is more deleterious than expected should evolve reduced expression noise to avoid concurrent low expression of both proteins. In apparent support, yeast genes with many epistatic partners have low expression variation both among isogenic individuals and between species. However, the specific predictions and basic assumptions of this verbal model remain untested. Using bioinformatics analysis, we first demonstrate that the model's predictions are unsupported by available large-scale data. Based on quantitative biochemical modeling, we then show that epistasis between expression reductions (epigenetic epistasis) is not expected to aggravate the fitness cost of stochastic expression, which is in sharp contrast to the verbal argument. This nonintuitive result can be readily explained by the typical diminishing return of fitness on gene activity and by the fact that expression noise not only decreases but also increases the abundance of proteins. Overall, we conclude that stochastic variation in epistatic partners is unlikely to drive noise minimization or constrain gene expression divergence on a genomic scale.",2017,34,380-390,10.1093/molbev/msw236
104,N,On the roles of repetitive DNA elements in the context of a unified genomic-epigenetic system,FROM EPIGENESIS TO EPIGENETICS: THE GENOME IN CONTEXT,"Repetitive DNA sequences comprise a substantial portion of most eukaryotic and some prokaryotic chromosomes. Despite nearly forty years of research, the functions of various sequence families as a whole and their monomer units remain largely unknown. The inability to map specific functional roles onto many repetitive DNA elements (RIES), coupled with the taxon-specificity of sequence families, have led many to speculate that these genomic components are selfish replicators generating genomic junk. The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the selfishness, evolutionary effects, and functionality of REs. First, a brief overview of the range of ideas pertaining to RE function is presented. Second, the argument is presented that the selfish DNA hypothesis is actually a narrative scheme, that it serves to protect neo-Darwinian assumptions from criticism, and that this story is untestable and therefore not a hypothesis. Third, attempts to synthesize the selfish DNA concept with complex systems models of the genome and RE functionality are critiqued. Fourth, the supposed connection between RE-induced mutations and macro-evolutionary events are stated to be at variance with empirical evidence and theoretical considerations. Hypotheses that base phylogenetic transitions in repetitive sequence changes thus remain speculative. Fifth and finally, the case is made for viewing RIES as integrally functional components of chromosomes, genomes, and cells. It is argued throughout that a new conceptual framework is needed for understanding the roles of repetitive DNA in genomic/epigenetic systems, and that neo-Darwinian narratives have been the primary obstacle to elucidating the effects of these enigmatic components of chromosomes.",2002,981,154-188,
105,N,Origination and innovation in the vertebrate limb skeleton: An epigenetic perspective,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,"The vertebrate limb has provided evolutionary and developmental biologists with grist for theory and experiment for at least a century. Its most salient features are its pattern of discrete skeletal elements, the general proximodistal increase in element number as development proceeds, and the individualization of size and shape of the elements in line with functional requirements. Despite increased knowledge of molecular changes during limb development, however, the mechanisms for origination and innovation of the vertebrate limb pattern are still uncertain. We suggest that the bauplan of the limb is based on an interplay of genetic and epigenetic processes; in particular, the self-organizing properties of precartilage mesenchymal tissue are proposed to provide the basis for its ability to generate regularly spaced nodules and rods of cartilage. We provide an experimentally based core set of cellular and molecular processes in limb mesenchyme that, under realistic conditions, exhibit the requisite self-organizing behavior for pattern origination. We describe simulations that show that under limb bud-like geometries the core mechanism gives rise to skeletons with authentic proximodistal spatiotemporal organization. Finally, we propose that evolution refines skeletal templates generated by this process by mobilizing accessory molecular and biomechanical regulatory processes to shape the developing limb and its individual elements. Morphological innovation may take place when such modulatory processes exceed a threshold defined by the dynamics of the skeletogenic system and elements are added or lost.",2005,304B,593-609,10.1002/jez.b.21066
106,N,Paternal epigenetic effects of population density on locust phase-related characteristics associated with heat-shock protein expression,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Many species exhibit transgenerational plasticity by which environmental cues experienced by either parent can be transmitted to their offspring, resulting in phenotypic variants in offspring to match ancestral environments. However, the manner by which paternal experiences affect offspring plasticity through epigenetic inheritance in animals generally remains unclear. In this study, we examined the transgenerational effects of population density on phase-related traits in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. Using an experimental design that explicitly controls genetic background, we found that the effects of crowd or isolation rearing on phase plasticity could be inherited to the offspring. The isolation of gregarious locusts resulted in reduced weight in offspring eggs and altered morphometric traits in hatchlings, whereas crowding of solitarious locusts exhibited opposite effects. The consequences of density changes were transmitted by both maternal and paternal inheritance, although the expression of paternal effects was not as pronounced as that of maternal effects. Prominent expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps), such as Hsp90,Hsp70 and Hsp20.6, could be triggered by density changes. Hsps were significantly upregulated upon crowding but downregulated upon isolation. The variation in parental Hsp expression was also transmitted to the offspring, in which the pattern of inheritance was consistent with that of phase characteristics. These results revealed a paternal effect on phase polyphenism and Hsp expression induced by population density, and defined a model system that could be used to study the paternal epigenetic inheritance of environmental changes.",2015,24,851-862,10.1111/mec.13072
107,N,PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AND EPIGENETIC MARKING: AN ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE FOR GENETIC ACCOMMODATION,EVOLUTION,"The relationship between genotype (which is inherited) and phenotype (the target of selection) is mediated by environmental inputs on gene expression, trait development, and phenotypic integration. Phenotypic plasticity or epigenetic modification might influence evolution in two general ways: (1) by stimulating evolutionary responses to environmental change via population persistence or by revealing cryptic genetic variation to selection, and (2) through the process of genetic accommodation, whereby natural selection acts to improve the form, regulation, and phenotypic integration of novel phenotypic variants. We provide an overview of models and mechanisms for how such evolutionary influences may be manifested both for plasticity and epigenetic marking. We point to promising avenues of research, identifying systems that can best be used to address the role of plasticity in evolution, as well as the need to apply our expanding knowledge of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms to our understanding of how genetic accommodation occurs in nature. Our review of a wide variety of studies finds widespread evidence for evolution by genetic accommodation.",2014,68,656-672,10.1111/evo.12348

We observed how the genetic and various environmental components of phenotypic variation scaled with the mean values of the traits. Temperature, yeast, within-environmental factors and genotype influenced the genotypic and environmental standard deviations of the two traits in patterns that point to very different modes of physiological and developmental action of these factors. Since different factors affected the environmental and genetic components of the phenotypic variation either in parallel or inversely, we conclude that environmental heterogeneity may have small or large effects on evolutionary rates depending on which factors cause the heterogeneity. The analysis also suggests that the scaling of variances with the mean is not as trivial as is often assumed when coefficients of variation are computed to ''standardize'' variation.",1993,6,17-29,10.1046/j.1420-9101.1993.6010017.x
109,N,Phylogenomics of the Epigenetic Toolkit Reveals Punctate Retention of Genes across Eukaryotes,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Epigenetic processes in eukaryotes play important roles through regulation of gene expression, chromatin structure, and genome rearrangements. The roles of chromatin modification (e.g., DNA methylation and histone modification) and non-protein-coding RNAs have been well studied in animals and plants. With the exception of a few model organisms (e.g., Saccharomyces and Plasmodium), much less is known about epigenetic toolkits across the remainder of the eukaryotic tree of life. Even with limited data, previous work suggested the existence of an ancient epigenetic toolkit in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. We use PhyloToL, our taxon-rich phylogenomic pipeline, to detect homologs of epigenetic genes and evaluate their macroevolutionary patterns among eukaryotes. In addition to data from GenBank, we increase taxon sampling from understudied clades of SAR (Stramenopila, Alveolata, and Rhizaria) and Amoebozoa by adding new single-cell transcriptomes from ciliates, foraminifera, and testate amoebae. We focus on 118 gene families, 94 involved in chromatin modification and 24 involved in non-protein-coding RNA processes based on the epigenetics literature. Our results indicate 1) the presence of a large number of epigenetic gene families in the last eukaryotic common ancestor; 2) differential conservation among major eukaryotic clades, with a notable paucity of genes within Excavata; and 3) punctate distribution of epigenetic gene families between species consistent with rapid evolution leading to gene loss. Together these data demonstrate the power of taxon-rich phylogenomic studies for illuminating evolutionary patterns at scales of > 1 billion years of evolution and suggest that macroevolutionary phenomena, such as genome conflict, have shaped the evolution of the eukaryotic epigenetic toolkit.",2020,12,2196-2210,10.1093/gbe/evaa198

113,N,Prediction of RNA Methylation Status From Gene Expression Data Using Classification and Regression Methods,EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS,"RNAN(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) has emerged as an important epigenetic modification for its role in regulating the stability, structure, processing, and translation of RNA. Instability of m(6)A homeostasis may result in flaws in stem cell regulation, decrease in fertility, and risk of cancer. To this day, experimental detection and quantification of RNA m(6)A modification are still time-consuming and labor-intensive. There is only a limited number of epitranscriptome samples in existing databases, and a matched RNA methylation profile is not often available for a biological problem of interests. As gene expression data are usually readily available for most biological problems, it could be appealing if we can estimate the RNA methylation status from gene expression data usingin silicomethods. In this study, we explored the possibility of computational prediction of RNA methylation status from gene expression data using classification and regression methods based on mouse RNA methylation data collected from 73 experimental conditions. Elastic Net-regularized Logistic Regression (ENLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) were constructed for classification. Both SVM and RF achieved the best performance with the mean area under the curve (AUC) = 0.84 across samples; SVM had a narrower AUC spread. Gene Site Enrichment Analysis was conducted on those sites selected by ENLR as predictors to access the biological significance of the model. Three functional annotation terms were found statistically significant: phosphoprotein, SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain, and endoplasmic reticulum. All 3 terms were found to be closely related to m(6)A pathway. For regression analysis, Elastic Net was implemented, which yielded a mean Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.68 and a mean Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.64. Our exploratory study suggested that gene expression data could be used to construct predictors for m(6)A methylation status with adequate accuracy. Our work showed for the first time that RNA methylation status may be predicted from the matched gene expression data. This finding may facilitate RNA modification research in various biological contexts when a matched RNA methylation profile is not available, especially in the very early stage of the study.",2020,16,1.18E+15,10.1177/1176934320915707
114,N,Profiling secondary metabolites of needles of ozone-fumigated white pine (Pinus strobus) clones by thermally assisted hydrolysis/methylation GC/MS,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,"Plant secondary metabolites have an important role in defense responses against herbivores and pathogens, and as a chemical barrier to elevated levels of harmful air pollutants. This study involves the rapid chemical profiling of phenolic and diterpene resin acids in needles of two (ozone-tolerant and ozone-sensitive) white pine (Pinus strobus) clones, fumigated with different ozone levels (control, and daily events peaking at 80 and 200 ppb) for 40 days. The phenolic and resin acids were measured using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Short-term fumigation affected the levels of two phenolic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids, in that both showed a substantial decrease in concentration with increased ozone dose. The decrease in concentration of these THM products may be caused by inhibition of the plant's shikimate biochemical pathway caused by ozone exposure. The combined occurrence of these two ozone-sensitive indicators has a role in biomonitoring of ozone levels and its impact on forest productivity. In addition, chromatographic profile differences in the major diterpene resin acid components were observed between ozone-tolerant and ozone-sensitive clones. The resin acids anticopalic, 3-oxoanticopalic, 3 beta-hydroxyanticopalic, and 3,4-cycloanticopalic acids were present in the ozone-sensitive pine; however, only anticopalic acid was present in the ozone-tolerant clone. This phenotypic variation in resin acid composition may be useful in distinguishing populations that are differentially adapted to air pollutants.",2007,33,1467-1476,10.1007/s10886-007-9314-1
115,N,"QUANTITATIVE GENETIC MODELS FOR DEVELOPMENT, EPIGENETIC SELECTION, AND PHENOTYPIC EVOLUTION",EVOLUTION,"Herein we describe a general multivariate quantitative genetic model that incorporates two potentially important developmental phenomena, maternal effects and epigenetic effects. Maternal and epigenetic effects are defined as partial regression coefficients and phenotypic variances are derived in terms of age-specific genetic and environmental variances. As a starting point, the traditional quantitative genetic model of additive gene effects and random environmental effects is cast in a developmental time framework. From this framework, we first extend a maternal effects model to include multiple developmental ages for the occurrence of maternal effects. An example of maternal effects occurring at multiple developmental ages is prenatal and postnatal maternal effects in mammals. Subsequently, a model of intrinsic and epigenetic effects in the absence of maternal effects is described. It is shown that genetic correlations can arise through epigenetic effects, and in the absence of other developmental effects, epigenetic effects are in general confounded with age-specific intrinsic genetic effects. Finally, the two effects are incorporated into the basic quantitative genetic model. For this more biologically realistic model combining maternal and epigenetic effects, it is shown that the phenotypic regressions of offspring on mother and offspring on father can be used in some cases to estimate simultaneously maternal effects and epigenetic effects.",1992,46,495-518,10.2307/2409867

In the highly eusocial honeybee (Apis mellifera), queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) is involved in the regulation of the reproductive and other behaviour of workers. The molecular mechanisms by which QMP acts are largely unknown. Here, we investigate how genes responsible for epigenetic modifications to DNA, RNA and histones respond to the presence of QMP in the environment. We show that several of these genes are upregulated in the honeybee brain when workers are exposed to artificial QMP. We propose that pheromonal communication systems, such as those used by social insects, evolved to respond to environmental signals by making use of existing epigenomic machineries.",2020,16,20200440,10.1098 sbl.2020.0440

120,N,Reconstructing the Ancestral Germ Line Methylation State of Young Repeats,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"One of the key objectives of comparative genomics is the characterization of the forces that shape genomes over the course of evolution. In the last decades, evidence has been accumulated that for vertebrate genomes also epigenetic modifications have to be considered in this context. Especially, the elevated mutation frequency of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is assumed to facilitate the depletion of CpG dinucleotides in species that exhibit global DNA methylation. For instance, the underrepresentation of CpG dinucleotides in many mammalian genomes is attributed to this effect, which is only neutralized in so-called CpG islands (CGIs) that are preferentially unmethylated and thus partially protected from rapid CpG decay. For primate-specific CpG-rich transposable elements from the ALU family, it is unclear whether their elevated CpG frequency is caused by their small age or by the absence of DNA methylation. In consequence, these elements are often misclassified in CGI annotations. We present a method for the estimation of germ line methylation from pairwise ancestral-descendant alignments. The approach is validated in a simulation study and tested on DNA repeats from the AluSx family. We conclude that a predicted unmethylated state in the germ line is highly correlated with epigenetic activity of the respective genomic region. Thus, CpG-rich repeats can be facilitated as in silico probes for the epigenetic potential of their genomic neighborhood.",2011,28,1777-1784,10.1093/molbev/msr001

However, sustainable use of economically important species without interfering with their ecology and evolution requires generating knowledge about the factors responsible for their genetic variation and diversity and, on this basis, their adaptation and speciation. Few genetic studies exploring the evolutionary relationships, speciation processes, genetic variability and diversity within species of Agave are currently available. Analyses of rDNA loci have been performed with the purpose of determining the genetic variability and diversity of the genus Agave, and these loci have been used as genetic markers of ploidy. However, the factors involved in the diversity of 5S rDNA regions in Agave have not yet been studied in depth. Our study explored the possible mechanisms of genetic (retroelements) and epigenetic (DNA methylation) diversity in 5S rDNA regions in Agave. We characterized the 5S rDNA gene tandem in species of the genus with different ploidy numbers and determined the levels of methylation in 13 haplotypes of 5S rDNA and in four non-transcribed spacers (NTS). Our results showed highly dynamic methylation with a high percentage in haplotypes and NTS of 5S rDNA regions in Agave. The characterization of the 5S rDNA tandem array in Agave revealed vestigial remains of the Cassandra terminal-repeat retrotransposon in miniature (TRIM). Our analysis supported previous results suggesting that in species of Agave L., regulation and diversity of 5S rDNA regions are controlled by coordinated genetic and epigenetic events, which will vary according to the species and the level of ploidy. The artificial pressure to which some agave crops are subjected may affect the mechanisms of evolution of gene 5S rDNA.",2018,86,404-423,10.1007/s00239-018-9856-6

124,N,Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"The sexes share the same autosomal genomes, yet sexual dimorphism is common due to sex-specific gene expression. When present, XX and XY karyotypes trigger alternate regulatory cascades that determine sex-specific gene expression profiles. In mammals, secretion of testosterone (T) by the testes during foetal development is the master switch influencing the gene expression pathways (male vs. female) that will be followed, but many genes have sex-specific expression prior to T secretion. Environmental factors, like endocrine disruptors and mimics, can interfere with sexual development. However, sex-specific ontogeny can be canalized by the production of epigenetic marks (epimarks) generated during early ontogeny that increase sensitivity of XY embryos to T and decrease sensitivity of XX embryos. Here, we integrate and synthesize the evidence indicating that canalizing epimarks are produced during early ontogeny. We will also describe the evidence that such epimarks sometimes carry over across generations and produce mosaicism in which some traits are discordant with the gonad. Such carryover epimarks are sexually antagonistic because they benefit the individual in which they were formed (via canalization) but harm opposite-sex offspring when they fail to erase across generations and produce gonad-trait discordances. SA-epimarks have the potential to: i) magnify phenotypic variation for many sexually selected traits, ii) generate overlap along many dimensions of the masculinity/femininity spectrum, and iii) influence medically important gonad-trait discordances like cryptorchidism, hypospadias and idiopathic hirsutism.",2016,25,1812-1822,10.1111/mec.13490

We found that the rapid responses of males to varying intensity of sperm competition not only affected sperm traits as shown previously, but also the performance of the resulting offspring. We observed that males exposed to high intensity of sperm competition produced faster swimming and more motile sperm, and sired offspring that hatched over a narrower time frame but exhibited a lower survival rate than males exposed to low intensity of sperm competition. Our results provide striking evidence for short-term paternal effects and the possible fitness consequences of such sperm-mediated non-genetic factors not only for the resulting offspring but also for the female.",2014,281,20140422,10.1098 spb.2014.0422

Random variation can also represent a proxy of developmental stability and can be used to assess how organisms deal with stressful environmental conditions.

128,N,Sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens are involved in arsenic methylation and demethylation in paddy soils,ISME JOURNAL,"Microbial arsenic (As) methylation and demethylation are important components of the As biogeochemical cycle. Arsenic methylation is enhanced under flooded conditions in paddy soils, producing mainly phytotoxic dimethylarsenate (DMAs) that can cause rice straighthead disease, a physiological disorder occurring widely in some rice growing regions. The key microbial groups responsible for As methylation and demethylation in paddy soils are unknown. Three paddy soils were incubated under flooded conditions. DMAs initially accumulated in the soil porewater, followed by a rapid disappearance coinciding with the production of methane. The soil from a rice straighthead disease paddy field produced a much larger amount of DMAs than the other two soils. Using metabolic inhibition, quantification of functional gene transcripts, microbial enrichment cultures and C-13-labeled DMAs, we show that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea are involved in As methylation and demethylation, respectively, controlling the dynamics of DMAs in paddy soils. We present a model of As biogeochemical cycle in paddy soils, linking the dynamics of changing soil redox potential with arsenite mobilization, arsenite methylation and subsequent demethylation driven by different microbial groups.

129,N,Syntrophic pathways for microbial mercury methylation,ISME JOURNAL,"Exposure to dietary sources of methylmercury (MeHg) is the focus of public health concerns with environmental mercury (Hg) contamination. MeHg is formed in anoxic environments by anaerobic microorganisms. This process has been studied mostly with single-species culture incubations, although the relevance of such studies to Hg(II)-methylation in situ is limited because microbial activities in the environment are critically modulated by interactions among microbial functional groups. Here we describe experiments in which Hg(II)-methylation was examined within the context of various microbial syntrophies. We show enhanced Hg(II)-methylation under conditions that established syntrophy by interspecies hydrogen and acetate transfer. Relative to activity of monocultures, interactions of Hg(II) methylating sulfate-reducing bacteria with a methanogen stimulated potential Hg(II)-methylation rates 2-fold to 9-fold, and with Syntrophobacter sp. 1.7-fold to 1.8-fold; those of a Hg(II) methylating Syntrophobacter sp. with a methanogen increased Hg(II)-methylation 2-fold. Under sulfatedepleted conditions, higher Hg(II)-methylation rates in the syntrophic incubations corresponded to higher free energy yields (Delta G degrees') than in the monocultures. Based on energetic considerations, we therefore propose that syntrophic microbial interactions are likely a major source of MeHg in sulfate-and iron-limited anoxic environments while in sulfate-replete environments, MeHg formation via sulfate reduction dominates.",2018,12,1826-1835,10.1038/s41396-018-0106-0
130,N,The adaptive value of epigenetic mutation: Limited in large but high in small peripheral populations,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"The fate of populations during range expansions, invasions and environmental changes is largely influenced by their ability to adapt to peripheral habitats. Recent models demonstrate that stable epigenetic modifications of gene expression that occur more frequently than genetic mutations can both help and hinder adaptation in panmictic populations. However, these models do not consider interactions between epimutations and evolutionary forces in peripheral populations. Here, we use mainland-island mathematical models and simulations to explore how the faster rate of epigenetic mutation compared to genetic mutations interacts with migration, selection and genetic drift to affect adaptation in peripheral populations. Our model focuses on cases where epigenetic marks are stably inherited. In a large peripheral population, where the effect of genetic drift is negligible, our analyses suggest that epimutations with random fitness impacts that occur at rates as high as 10(-3) increase local adaptation when migration is strong enough to overwhelm divergent selection. When migration is weak relative to selection and epimutations with random fitness impacts decrease adaptation, we find epigenetic modifications must be highly adaptively biased to enhance adaptation. Finally, in small peripheral populations, where genetic drift is strong, epimutations contribute to adaptation under a wider range of evolutionary conditions. Overall, our results suggest that epimutations can change outcomes of adaptation in peripheral populations, which has implications for understanding conservation and range expansions and contractions, especially of small populations.",2019,32,1391-1405,10.1111/jeb.13535

Several studies have shown that the impact of environmental exposures on the epigenome takes on more importance during early fertilization and embryonic development, given that during these periods epigenetic reprogramming occurs and the new epigenetic profile of the offspring is established. Epigenetic alterations in the germline are especially relevant since they can be transmitted trans-generationally and could be associated with a wide range of diseases including several reproductive disorders. In this chapter we review some epigenetic mechanisms, focusing mainly on DNA methylation and histone modifications, which are related to reproductive aspects, and we discuss the controversies in the literature surrounding how environmental conditions, such as exposure to toxic substances or treatment with assisted reproductive techniques (ART), may be involved in epigenetic alterations that affect reproductive success.",2014,753,97-117,10.1007/978-1-4939-0820-2_6

133,N,The evolutionary potential of paramutation: A population-epigenetic model,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,"Paramutation involves an interaction between homologous alleles resulting in a heritable change in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Initially believed to be restricted to plants, paramutation has recently been observed in animal models, and a paramutation-like event has been noted in humans. Despite the accumulating evidence suggesting that trans-acting epigenetic effects can be inherited transgenerationally and therefore generate non-genomic phenotypic variation, these effects have been largely ignored in the context of evolutionary theory. The model presented here incorporates paramutation into the standard model of viability selection at one locus and demonstrates that paramutation can create long-term biological diversity in the absence of genetic change, and even in the absence of the original paramutagenic allele. Therefore, if paramutation is present, attributing evolution to only a traditional genetic model may fail to encompass the broad scope of phenotypic differences observed in nature. Moreover, we show also that an unusual mathematical behaviour, analogous to Ewens' gap of the two-locus two-allele symmetric-selection model, occurs: when the rate of one parameter - for example, the rate of paramutation - is increased, a pair of equilibria may disappear only to reappear as this parameter increases further. In summary, by incorporating even the simplest epigenetic parameters into the standard population-genetic model of selection, we show how this type of inheritance system can profoundly alter the course of evolution.

134,N,The lateral mesodermal divide: an epigenetic model of the origin of paired fins,EVOLUTION & DEVELOPMENT,"By examining development at the level of tissues and processes, rather than focusing on gene expression, we have formulated a general hypothesis to explain the dorso-ventral and anterior-posterior placement of paired appendage initiation sites in vertebrates. According to our model, the number and position of paired appendages are due to a commonality of embryonic tissue environments determined by the global interactions involving the two separated layers (somatic and visceral) of lateral plate mesoderm along the dorso-ventral and anterior-posterior axes of the embryo. We identify this distribution of developmental conditions, as modulated by the separation/contact of the two LPM layers and their interactions with somitic mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm as a dynamic developmental entity which we have termed the lateral mesodermal divide (LMD). Where the divide results in a certain tissue environment, fin bud initiation can occur. According to our hypothesis, the influence of the developing gut suppresses limb initiation along the midgut region and the ventral body wall owing to an endodermal predominance. From an evolutionary perspective, the lack of gut regionalization in agnathans reflects the ancestral absence of these conditions, and the elaboration of the gut together with the concomitant changes to the LMD in the gnathostomes could have led to the origin of paired fins.",2014,16,38-48,10.1111/ede.12061
135,N,The penetrance of an epigenetic trait in mice is progressively yet reversibly increased by selection and environment,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Natural selection acts on variation that is typically assumed to be genetic in origin. But epigenetic mechanisms, which are interposed between the genome and its environment, can create diversity independently of genetic variation. Epigenetic states can respond to environmental cues, and can be heritable, thus providing a means by which environmentally responsive phenotypes might be selectable independent of genotype. Here, we have tested the possibility that environment and selection can act together to increase the penetrance of an epigenetically determined phenotype. We used isogenic A(vy) mice, in which the epigenetic state of the A(vy) allele is sensitive to dietary methyl donors. By combining methyl donor supplementation with selection for a silent A(vy) allele, we progressively increased the prevalence of the associated phenotype in the population over five generations. After withdrawal of the dietary supplement, the shift persisted for one generation but was lost in subsequent generations. Our data provide the first demonstration that selection for a purely epigenetic trait can result in cumulative germline effects in mammals. These results present an alternative to the paradigm that natural selection acts only on genetic variation, and suggest that epigenetic changes could underlie rapid adaptation of species in response to natural environmental fluctuations.",2012,279,2347-2353,10.1098 spb.2011.2646

However, the evolutionary implications of such alternative mechanisms of inheritance remain unclear. Herein, we show that epigenetic mechanisms can serve two fundamentally different functions in transgenerational inheritance: (i) selection-based effects, which carry adaptive information in virtue of selection over many generations of reliable transmission; and (ii) detection-based effects, which are a transgenerational form of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The two functions interact differently with a third form of epigenetic information transmission, namely information about cell state transmitted for somatic cell heredity in multicellular organisms. Selection-based epigenetic information is more likely to conflict with somatic cell inheritance than is detection-based epigenetic information. Consequently, the evolutionary implications of epigenetic mechanisms are different for unicellular and multicellular organisms, which underscores the conceptual and empirical importance of distinguishing between these two different forms of transgenerational epigenetic effect.",2011,24,1178-1187,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02235.x
138,N,Trajectory analysis among African hominoids can provide insights into genetic and epigenetic influences during ontogeny,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"ObjectivesPrior examination of the ontogeny of Hominoid talo-crural joint morphology using Singular Warp analysis suggested both a genetic and epigenetic signal during development. This question is examined using trajectory analysis and its implications for the Hominin fossil record explored. Materials and methodsTrajectory analysis was used to examine talo-crural joint shape at different molar eruption stages during development among a cohort of 221 specimens of Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, and Pan paniscus. Trajectory length, angle, and shape were compared among species. Trajectories that showed a consistent pattern of shape change were predicted to show a genetic signal, while change in that pattern an epigenetic signal. ResultsThe trajectories of all four hominoid tali were consistent during M1-M2 development, but there was a change in Pan paniscus alone at M2-M3. The tibial trajectories were again consistent in M1-M2 development, however, only Pan paniscus persisted in this trajectory at M2-M3 while the other three changed. DiscussionTrajectory analysis demonstrated an epigenetic signal in Pan paniscus in the talus and among the other three hominoids in the tibia. Behavioral (epigenetic) changes may impact hominoid ankle shape in extant species. These changes may reflect differences in locomotor repertoire altering shape, as has been suggested in the Hominin fossil record. Further examination of closely related hominoid species may provide insights into potential behavioral influences in the rapid change and diversity of Hominin talo-crural shape in the Plio-pleistocene.",2018,167,173-177,10.1002/ajpa.23625
139,N,Transposable Elements and DNA Methylation Create in Embryonic Stem Cells Human-Specific Regulatory Sequences Associated with Distal Enhancers and Noncoding RNAs,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Despite significant progress in the structural and functional characterization of the human genome, understanding of the mechanisms underlying the genetic basis of human phenotypic uniqueness remains limited. Here, I report that transposable element-derived sequences, most notably LTR7/HERV-H, LTR5_Hs, and L1HS, harbor 99.8% of the candidate human-specific regulatory loci (HSRL) with putative transcription factor-binding sites in the genome of human embryonic stem cells (hESC). A total of 4,094 candidate HSRL display selective and site-specific binding of critical regulators(NANOG[Nanoghomeobox], POU5F1[POU class 5 homeobox 1], CCCT C-binding factor [CTCF], Lamin B1), and are preferentially located within the matrix of transcriptionally active DNA segments that are hypermethylated in hESC. hESC-specific NANOG-binding sites are enriched near the protein-coding genes regulating brain size, pluripotency long noncoding RNAs, hESC enhancers, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-harboring regions immediately adjacent to binding sites. Sequences of only 4.3% of hESC-specific NANOG-binding sites are present in Neanderthals' genome, suggesting that a majority of these regulatory elements emerged in Modern Humans. Comparisons of estimated creation rates of novel TF-binding sites revealed that there was 49.7-fold acceleration of creation rates of NANOG-binding sites in genomes of Chimpanzees compared with the mouse genomes and further 5.7-fold acceleration in genomes of Modern Humans compared with the Chimpanzees genomes. Preliminary estimates suggest that emergence of one novel NANOG-binding site detectable in hESC required 466 years of evolution. Pathway analysis of coding genes that have hESC-specific NANOG-binding sites within gene bodies or near gene boundaries revealed their association with physiological development and functions of nervous and cardiovascular systems, embryonic development, behavior, as well as development of a diverse spectrum of pathological conditions such as cancer, diseases of cardiovascular and reproductive systems, metabolic diseases, multiple neurological and psychological disorders. A proximity placement model is proposed explaining how a 33-47% excess of NANOG, CTCF, and POU5F1 proteins immobilized on a DNA scaffold may play a functional role at distal regulatory elements.",2015,7,1432-1454,10.1093/gbe/evv081

However, we still have a very limited understanding of the evolutionary potential of epigenetic variation, in particular in comparison to DNA sequence-based variation. To address this question, we compared the magnitudes of heritable phenotypic variation in epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana-lines that mainly differ in DNA methylation but only very little in DNA sequence-with other types of A. thaliana lines that differ strongly also in DNA sequence. We grew subsets of two epiRIL populations with subsets of two genetic RIL populations, of natural ecotype collections, and of lines from a natural population in a common environment and assessed their heritable variation in growth, phenology, and fitness. Among-line phenotypic variation and broad-sense heritabilities tended to be largest in natural ecotypes, but for some traits the variation among epiRILs was comparable to that among RILs and natural ecotypes. Within-line phenotypic variation was generally similar in epiRILs, RILs, and ecotypes. Provided that phenotypic variation in epiRILs is mainly caused by epigenetic differences, whereas in RILs and natural lines it is largely driven by sequence variation, our results indicate that epigenetic variation has the potential to create phenotypic variation that is stable and substantial, and thus of evolutionary significance.",2018,121,257-265,10.1038/s41437-018-0095-9
142,N,When is incomplete epigenetic resetting in germ cells favoured by natural selection?,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Resetting of epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, in germ cells or early embryos is not always complete. Epigenetic states may therefore persist, decay or accumulate across generations. In spite of mounting empirical evidence for incomplete resetting, it is currently poorly understood whether it simply reflects stochastic noise or plays an adaptive role in phenotype determination. Here, we use a simple model to show that incomplete resetting can be adaptive in heterogeneous environments. Transmission of acquired epigenetic states prevents mismatched phenotypes when the environment changes infrequently relative to generation time and when maternal and environmental cues are unreliable. We discuss how these results may help to interpret the emerging data on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in plants and animals.",2015,282,20150682,10.1098 spb.2015.0682
143,N,Between-Generation Phenotypic and Epigenetic Stability in a Clonal Snail,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Epigenetic variation might play an important role in generating adaptive phenotypes by underpinning within-generation developmental plasticity, persistent parental effects of the environment (e.g., transgenerational plasticity), or heritable epigenetically based polymorphism. These adaptive mechanisms should be most critical in organisms where genetic sources of variation are limited. Using a clonally reproducing freshwater snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), we examined the stability of an adaptive phenotype (shell shape) and of DNA methylation between generations. First, we raised three generations of snails adapted to river currents in the lab without current. We showed that habitat-specific adaptive shell shape was relatively stable across three generations but shifted slightly over generations two and three toward a no-current lake phenotype. We also showed that DNA methylation specific to high-current environments was stable across one generation. This study provides the first evidence of stability of DNA methylation patterns across one generation in an asexual animal. Together, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptive shell shape variation is at least in part determined by transgenerational plasticity, and that DNA methylation provides a potential mechanism for stability of shell shape across one generation.",2020,12,1604-1615,10.1093/gbe/evaa181
144,N,Concordance in hippocampal and fecal Nr3c1 methylation is moderated by maternal behavior in the mouse,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Recent advances in genomic technologies now enable a reunion of molecular and evolutionary biology. Researchers investigating naturally living animal populations are thus increasingly able to capitalize upon genomic technologies to connect molecular findings with multiple levels of biological organization. Using this vertical approach in the laboratory, epigenetic gene regulation has emerged as an important mechanism integrating genotype and phenotype. To connect phenotype to population fitness, however, this same vertical approach must now be applied to naturally living populations. A major obstacle to studying epigenetics in noninvasive samples is tissue specificity of epigenetic marks. Here, using the mouse as a proof-of-principle model, we present the first known attempt to validate an epigenetic assay for use in noninvasive samples. Specifically, we compare DNA methylation of the NGFI-A (nerve growth factor-inducible protein A) binding site in the promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) gene between central (hippocampal) and peripheral noninvasive (fecal) tissues in juvenile Balb/c mice that had received varying levels of postnatal maternal care. Our results indicate that while hippocampal DNA methylation profiles correspond to maternal behavior, fecal DNA methylation levels do not. Moreover, concordance in methylation levels between these tissues within individuals only emerges after accounting for the effects of postnatal maternal care. Thus, although these findings may be specific to the Nr3c1 gene, we urge caution when interpreting DNA methylation patterns from noninvasive tissues, and offer suggestions for further research in this field.",2012,2,3123-3131,10.1002/ece3.416
145,N,DNA Methylation as a Mechanism of Nutritional Plasticity: Limited Support From Horned Beetles,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,"Epigenetic changes to DNA, potentially heritable alterations above the sequence level, such as DNA methylation, are thought to underlie many instances of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Our understanding of the links between epigenetic variation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity in natural populations is limited. If DNA methylation underlies adaptive responses to different nutritional environments, methylation patterns should be correlated with differences in performance across nutritional environments, and respond to changes in the environment. Additionally, genotypes that can cope with a broader range of nutritional environments are expected to have greater flexibility in methylation patterns. We tested these predictions using horned beetles (genus Onthophagus), which can cope with a wide range of variation in larval nutrition. We surveyed levels of methylation across several methylated loci in lab-reared beetles originating from natural populations using a methylation-specific amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. For less than half the of the loci investigated, methylation level was correlated with performance, measured as adult body size attained on a given diet, in different nutritional environments, with an overall greater effect in males (the more nutritionally plastic sex) than females. Methylation levels at most sites were influenced more by genotype (iso-female line) than by environment (dung type). Only 1 site (of 12) showed a significant genotype-by-environment interaction. Taken together, our results provide modest support for the hypothesis that DNA methylation underlies nutritional plasticity, as only 816% of methylated sites conformed to all of our predictions. J.

Changes in thyroid hormone receptor signalling may be related to differences in maternal care received and DNA methylation modifications. We investigated the effects of variations in temperature exposure (a proxy of maternal contact) and licking-like tactile stimulation on these processes in week-old female rat pups. We assessed thyroid hormone receptor signalling by measuring circulating triiodothyronine and transcript abundance of thyroid hormone receptors and the thyroid hormone-responsive genes DNA methyltransferase 3a and oxytocin in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. DNA methylation of the oxytocin promoter was assessed in relation to changes in thyroid hormone receptor binding. Repeated room temperature exposure was associated with a decrease in thyroid hormone receptor signalling measures relative to nest temperature exposure, while acute room temperature exposure was associated with an increase. Repeated room temperature exposure also increased thyroid hormone receptor binding and DNA methylation at the oxytocin promoter. These findings suggest that repeated room temperature exposure may affect DNA methylation levels as a consequence of alterations in thyroid hormone receptor signalling.",2020,287,20201991,10.1098 spb.2020.1991
148,N,Effect of early experience on neuronal and behavioral responses to con- and heterospecific odors in closely related Mus taxa: epigenetic contribution in formation of precopulatory isolation,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"BackgroundThe most effective learning occurs during sensitive periods. Olfactory plasticity to main social olfactory cues is limited to a critical period to a large degree. The objective was to evaluate the influence of early olfactory experience on the behavioral and neuronal responses of males to con- and heterospecific odors of receptive females in two species, M. musculus (subspecies musculus, wagneri) and M. spicilegus, and thus to determine the potential role of epigenetic contribution in the formation of precopulatory isolation.ResultsMales were reciprocally cross-fostered shortly after the birth and were tested for response to con- and heterospecific urine odors of estrus females using two-choice tests at 70-85days of age. Neuronal activity of non- and cross-fostered males was evaluated at 90-110days of age in the MOB and AOB to con- and heterospecific female odor using fMRI (MEMRI). Non-cross-fostered males of three taxa demonstrated a strong preference for odor of conspecific females compared to odor of heterospecific ones. Spicilegus-nursed musculus preferred odor of heterospecific females. Wagneri-nursed spicilegus and spicilegus-nursed wagneri did not demonstrate significant choice of con - or heterospecific female odor. The level of MRI signal obtained from the evaluation of manganese accumulation in AOB neurons was significantly higher when the odor of conspecific estrus females was exposed, compared to urine exposure of heterospecific females. The response pattern changed to the opposite in males raised by heterospecific females. Response patterns of neuronal activity in the MOB to con- and heterospecific female odors were different in cross-fostered and control males.ConclusionThe maternal environment, including odor, had a greater effect on the level of MRI signal in the AOB than the genetic relationships of the recipient and the donor of the odor stimulus. Behavioral and neuronal responses to con- and heterospecific odors changed in closely related Mus taxa as a result of early experience. We demonstrated the importance of early learning in mate choice in adulthood in mice and the possibility of epigenetic contribution in the formation of precopulatory reproductive isolation.",2019,19,51,10.1186/s12862-019-1373-8
149,N,Effect of NMDA receptor activity on histone H3 methylation and its asymmetry in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons of rats with different excitability thresholds under normal and stress conditions,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"Process of methylation of histone H3 for lysine 4 (H3K4) was studied in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of rats-intact and submitted to emotional-pain stress with active and inactivated channels of NMDA-receptors with taking into account the interhemisphere lateralization and in connection with the genetically determined level of excitability of the animals' nervous system. There were revealed interstrain differences in the basal level of the H3K4 methylation whose direction depends on structural-functional peculiarities of hippocampal fields and lateralization. Under action of stress the direction of the observed changes in the degree of the H3K4 methylation depended on the functional states of channels of NMDA-receptors. On the background of active receptors the proportion of immunopositive cells predominantly increased. In the CA1 field this change was not connected with excitability and lateralization, whereas in the CA3 field it had a complex character and depended on these two factors. At inactivation of channels of NMDA-receptors the portion of immunopositive nuclei as a result of the stress action, on the contrary, predominantly decreased; interstrain specificity of these changes was connected with lateralization, while its direction in different hippocampal fields was different. Action of the short-time emotional-pain stress did not lead to a change of shape of interhemisphere at active state of receptors, whereas at inactivation of receptors it changes depending on the structural-functional organization of hippocampus and on excitability of the nervous system.",2013,49,615-623,10.1134/S0022093013060091
150,N,Epigenetic and Genetic Contributions to Adaptation in Chlamydomonas,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, can be transmitted between cellular or organismal generations. However, there are no experiments measuring their role in adaptation, so here we use experimental evolution to investigate how epigenetic variation can contribute to adaptation. We manipulated DNA methylation and histone acetylation in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii both genetically and chemically to change the amount of epigenetic variation generated or transmitted in adapting populations in three different environments (salt stress, phosphate starvation, and high CO2) for two hundred asexual generations. We find that reducing the amount of epigenetic variation available to populations can reduce adaptation in environments where it otherwise happens. From genomic and epigenomic sequences from a subset of the populations, we see changes in methylation patterns between the evolved populations over-represented in some functional categories of genes, which is consistent with some of these differences being adaptive. Based on whole genome sequencing of evolved clones, the majority of DNA methylation changes do not appear to be linked to cis-acting genetic mutations. Our results show that transgenerational epigenetic effects play a role in adaptive evolution, and suggest that the relationship between changes in methylation patterns and differences in evolutionary outcomes, at least for quantitative traits such as cell division rates, is complex.",2017,34,2285-2306,10.1093/molbev/msx166

151,N,Epigenetic effects on the mouse mandible: common features and discrepancies in remodeling due to muscular dystrophy and response to food consistency,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: In wild populations phenotypic differentiation of skeletal structures is influenced by many factors including epigenetic interactions and plastic response to environmental influences, possibly blurring the expression of genetic differences. In contrast, laboratory animals provide the opportunity to separate environmental from genetic effects. The mouse mandible is particularly prone to such plastic variations because bone remodeling occurs late in postnatal ontogeny, in interaction with muscular loading. In order to understand the impact of this process on mandible morphology, we investigated how change in the masticatory function affects the mandible shape, and its pattern of variation. Breeding laboratory mice on food of different consistencies mimicked a natural variation in feeding ecology, whereas mice affected by the murine analogue of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy provided a case of pathological modification of the mastication process. Results: Food consistency as well as dystrophy caused significant shape changes in the mouse mandible. Further differences were observed between laboratory strains and between sexes within strains, muscular dystrophy causing the largest morphological change. The directions of the morphological changes due to food consistency and muscular dystrophy were discrepant, despite the fact that both are related to bone remodeling. In contrast, directions of greatest variance were comparable among most groups, and the direction of the change due to sexual dimorphism was parallel to the direction of main variance. Conclusions: Bone remodeling is confirmed as an important factor driving mandible shape differences, evidenced by differences due to both the consistency of the food ingested and muscular dystrophy. However, the resulting shape change will depend on how the masticatory function is affected. Muscular dystrophy caused shape changes distributed all over the mandible, all muscles being affected although possibly to a different degree. In contrast, the chewing function was mostly affected when the mice were fed on hard vs. soft food, whereas grinding likely occurred normally; accordingly, shape change was more localized. The direction of greatest variance, however, was remarkably comparable among groups, although we found a residual variance discarding age, sex, and food differences. This suggests that whatever the context in which bone remodeling occurs, some parts of the mandible such as the angular process are more prone to remodeling during late postnatal growth.",2010,10,28,10.1186/1471-2148-10-28
152,N,Epigenetic gene silencing alters the mechanisms and rate of evolutionary adaptation,NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,"Epigenetic, non-DNA sequence-based inheritance can potentially contribute to adaptation but, due to its transient nature and the difficulty involved in uncoupling it from genetic variation, it is unclear whether it has any effect on long-term evolution. However, short-term epigenetic inheritance may interact with genetic change by modifying the rate and type of adaptive mutations. Here, we test this notion in an experimental evolution set-up in yeast. We tune low, intermediate and high levels of heritable silencing of a URA3 reporter under selection by insertion at different positions within silent subtelomeric chromatin in otherwise isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Heritable silencing does not impact mutation rate but drives population size expansion and rapid epigenetic adaptation. This eventually leads to genetic assimilation of the silent phenotype by mutations that reduce or abolish URA3 expression. Moreover, at intermediate or low levels of heritable silencing we find that populations evolve more rapidly by accumulation of adaptive mutations, in part through acquisition of novel alleles that enhance gene silencing, aiding accelerated adaptation. We provide an experimental proof of concept that defines the impact and mechanisms of how short-term epigenetic inheritance can shape adaptive evolution.",2019,3,491-+,10.1038/s41559-018-0781-2
153,N,Epigenetic Plasticity Following Early Stress Predicts Long-Term Health Outcomes in Rhesus Macaques,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"Early life stress has been linked with poorer lifelong health outcomes across species, including modern and ancient humans. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation patterning of stress pathway genes in stress-responsive tissue, may play an important role in the long-term health effects of early stress across species. The relationships among early maternal care quality, DNA methylation patterns in a candidate stress pathway gene (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT) linked region in blood DNA, and adult health outcomes were examined in male and female rhesus macaques, excellent models of human health. Male (n=12) and female (n=32) infants were observed with their mothers for the first 12 weeks of life and 5-HTT linked DNA methylation was measured in blood at 12 weeks of age. Approximately 8 years later, health-related measures were collected for the 25 animals (6 male and 19 female) that were available for study. Health composite scores were generated using factor analysis of body condition, body weight, and diagnosis of diarrhea during the lifespan. Better quality maternal care predicted lower 5-HTT linked methylation at 12 weeks of age. Lower 5-HTT methylation, in turn, predicted better health composite scores in adulthood, including better body condition, greater body weight and absence of lifetime diarrhea. These data suggest that the epigenetic regulation of 5-HTT may be one biomarker of the link between early stress and lifetime health trajectories. Future studies will examine whether epigenetic signatures in modern and ancient human DNA lends insight into stress and health and natural selection in human evolutionary history.

154,N,EpiRADseq: scalable analysis of genomewide patterns of methylation using next-generation sequencing,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. Research addressing the role of epigenetics in a diversity of experimental and natural systems is rapidly accumulating. Diverse methods have been developed to study epigenetic states, including bisulphite sequencing and AFLP-based approaches. However, existing methods are sometimes difficult to apply to non-traditional model organisms that lack genomic resources (bisulphite sequencing), and can fail to be economical and readily scalable to diverse research questions because of reliance on traditional Sanger sequencing (AFLP approaches). 2. Here we develop a reduced-representation library-based approach that is scalable and economical to quantitatively compare patterns of genomewide methylation. This approach shares substantial similarity to the now widely used double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing-based method (ddRADseq), except that it utilizes a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. This method therefore identifies changes in the genomic methylation state of cytosine (to 5-methylcytosine; 5mC) by sampling loci (via next-generation sequencing) that are not methylated within a sample. We test this method to identify shifts in the epigenome of clonal water fleas (Daphnia ambigua) in response to exposure to fish predator cues, which are known to induce transgenerational changes in life-history traits. 3. We found evidence for differential transgenerational responses (inferred via significant shifts in the methylation state of sampled loci) to predator cues among our treatment groups and remarkably consistent responses within treatment groups. Our results demonstrate that this method is capable of producing highly repeatable results even without the use of a reference genome. 4. Applications of this general method are broad and diverse and include the analysis of epigenetic shifts in both experimental and natural study systems.",2016,7,60-69,10.1111/2041-210X.12435
155,N,Evolution of an Epigenetic Gene Ensemble within the Genus Anopheles,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Epigenetic control of gene expression has important implications for the regulation of developmental processes, for mediating homeostasis and responses to the external environment, and for transgenerational inheritance of gene expression patterns. Genes that mediate epigenetic control have been well-characterized in Drosophila melanogaster, and we have identified and analyzed an orthologous gene ensemble in Anopheles gambiae that comprises 169 orthologs related to a 215-member epigenetic gene ensemble in D. melanogaster. We find that this ensemble is highly conserved among anopheline mosquitoes, as we identify only seven gene family expansion/contraction events within the ensemble among 12 mosquito species we have studied within the genus Anopheles. Comparative analyses of the epigenetic gene expression across the genera Drosophila and Anopheles reveal distinct tissue-associated expression patterns in the two genera, but similar temporal expression patterns. The A. gambiae complex and D. melanogaster subgroup epigenetic gene ensembles exhibit similar evolutionary rates, as assessed by their respective dN/dS values. These differences in tissue-associated expression patterns, in contrast to similarities in evolutionary rates and temporal expression patterns, may imply that some members of the epigenetic gene ensemble have been redeployed within one or both genera, in comparison to the most recent common ancestor of these two clades. Members of this epigenetic gene ensemble may constitute another set of potential targets for vector control and enable further reductions in the burden of humanmalaria, by analogy to recent success in development of small molecule antagonists for mammalian epigenetic machinery.",2015,7,901-915,10.1093/gbe/evv041
156,N,Exposure to a competitive social environment activates an epigenetic mechanism that limits pheomelanin synthesis in zebra finches,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Competitive environments promote high testosterone levels, produce oxidative stress and, consequently, impair cellular homeostasis. The regulation of genes involved in the synthesis of the pigment pheomelanin in melanocytes seems to help to maintain homeostasis against environmental oxidative stress. Here, we experimentally increased social interactions in some zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) males by keeping them in groups of six birds during feather growth, while others were kept alone, to test if melanocytes show epigenetic lability under a competitive social environment. As these changes may depend on the oxidative status, we administrated buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) to decrease the antioxidant capacity of some birds. The competitive environment downregulated a gene involved in pheomelanin synthesis (Slc7a11) by changing the level of DNA methylation in feather melanocytes. In other genes involved in pheomelanin synthesis (Slc45a2, MC1R and AGRP), DNA methylation was also affected, but no changes in expression were detected. Exposure to the competitive environment did not affect systemic oxidative stress and damage, indicating that a protective epigenetic mechanism that changes the expression of Slc7a11 may have been activated. However, no changes to the pigmentation phenotype of birds were found, probably due to the short duration or low intensity of the competitive environment.

157,N,"Imprinted expression of the canine IGF2R, in the absence of an anti-sense transcript or promoter methylation",EVOLUTION & DEVELOPMENT,"Imprinted genes are epigenetically modified in a parent of origin-dependent manner, and as a consequence, are differentially expressed. Although the evolution of genomic imprinting is a subject of intense debate, imprinted genes have been studied primarily in mice and humans and in a small number of marsupial mammals. Comparative studies involving rodents and primates are of limited value, as they belong to the same superordinal group of eutherian mammals (Euarchontoglires). On the other hand, comparisons involving marsupials may not be informative, due to phylogenetic distance. Canis familiaris belongs to Laurasiatheria, a sister-group of Euarchontoglires, and should prove useful in comparative studies of imprinted genes. Using RT-PCR we demonstrate monoallelic expression of the canine IGF2R in several tissues, including uterus and umbilical cord. In the case of umbilical cord, we identify the expressed allele as maternally derived. The canine IGF2R is thus an imprinted gene. Using bisulfite sequencing, we show that the canine IGF2R resembles the imprinted mouse Igf2r in having a CpG island in intron 2 that is hemi-methylated. However, it differs from the mouse gene in that maintenance of the monoallelic expression of canine IGF2R does not require expression of an anti-sense transcript from the paternally derived allele, or methylation of the repressed IGF2R promoter. In these two important features, the imprinted canine gene resembles the imprinted opossum IGF2R. Our data suggest that these features were properties of the ancestral imprinted IGF2R and that the anti-sense transcript (Air) and promoter methylation observed in mouse are derived features of the mouse Igf2r locus.",2007,9,579-589,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00198.x

165,N,Intraspecific and interspecific investigations of skeletal DNA methylation and femur morphology in primates,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"Objectives Epigenetic mechanisms influence the development and maintenance of complex phenotypes and may also contribute to the evolution of species-specific phenotypes. With respect to skeletal traits, little is known about the gene regulation underlying these hard tissues or how tissue-specific patterns are associated with bone morphology or vary among species. To begin exploring these topics, this study evaluates one epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, in skeletal tissues from five nonhuman primate species which display anatomical and locomotor differences representative of their phylogenetic groups. Materials and Methods First, we test whether intraspecific variation in skeletal DNA methylation is associated with intraspecific variation in femur morphology. Second, we identify interspecific differences in DNA methylation and assess whether these lineage-specific patterns may have contributed to species-specific morphologies. Specifically, we use the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip to identify DNA methylation patterns in femur trabecular bone from baboons (n= 28), macaques (n= 10), vervets (n= 10), chimpanzees (n= 4), and marmosets (n= 6). Results Significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with a subset of morphological variants, but these likely have small biological effects and may be confounded by other variables associated with morphological variation. Conversely, several species-specific DMPs were identified, and these are found in genes enriched for functions associated with complex skeletal traits. Discussion Overall, these findings reveal that while intraspecific epigenetic variation is not readily associated with skeletal morphology differences, some interspecific epigenetic differences in skeletal tissues exist and may contribute to evolutionarily distinct phenotypes. This work forms a foundation for future explorations of gene regulation and skeletal trait evolution in primates.",2020,173,34-49,10.1002/ajpa.24041
166,N,Molecular microevolution and epigenetic patterns of the long non-coding gene H19 show its potential function in pig domestication and breed divergence,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: The domestic pig Sus scrofa domesticus originated from the wild boar S. scrofa about 10,000 years ago. During domestication, drastic morphological, physiological, and behavioral changes developed between domestic pigs and wild boars through artificial and natural selection. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19, which is located within the imprinting gene cluster H19-IGF2, plays an important role in regulating muscle development in humans and mice. This study systematically analyzed the molecular evolution of H19 and its possible epigenetic changes during pig domestication and breeding to explore the genetic and epigenetic contributions of H19 to pig domestication. Results: The molecular evolution of H19 was initially analyzed on a large phylogenetic scale. Results showed that the gene was highly conserved within a broad range, especially in the 5' terminal sequence. The molecular evolution of the gene was then analyzed using published re-sequencing data of 30 wild boars from Tibet, 3 wild boars from Sichuan, and 15 native pigs from other regions in China. Eight polymorphic sites were identified, and the nucleotide diversity (pi) value within the H19 gene body was significantly higher (Z-test, P < 0.05) in domesticated pigs than in wild pigs. However, no significant divergence occurred between domesticated and wild pigs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 3' terminal sequence were surveyed in other Chinese local breeds and foreign pig breeds. We observed a consistently higher diversity in domesticated pigs than in wild pigs. The methylation pattern of the H19 gene in pigs was subsequently analyzed using published methylated DNA immunoprecipitation data and an unpublished single-base resolution liver methylome. Analysis results showed distinct methylation levels in some tissues. Among the samples surveyed, Landrace showed the lowest methylation level, followed by the Guizhou wild boar, whereas the Enshi pig exhibited the highest methylation level in the 2 kb upstream region of the H19 gene. Liver transcriptome data suggested that Landrace harbored the highest expression of the H19 gene, followed by the Guizhou wild boar, whereas the Enshi pig harbored the lowest expression of the gene. Differential methylation sites (DMSs) among the three breeds were mainly identified in the 2 kb upstream region of the H19 gene. In the Enshi pig, we detected allele-specific methylation (ASM) regions in the 2 kb upstream region of the H19 gene. Most of the DMSs in the upstream 2 kb region of the gene were also located in the ASM region in this breed. Conclusions: Molecular analyses suggest that the H19 gene was highly conserved during large-scale evolution and exhibited genotype differentiation during domestication and breed differentiation. The drastic diversity pattern between domestic and wild pigs in the H19 gene body, which was highly conserved during large-scale evolution, suggests that this gene might have played roles in the breed differentiation of domestic pigs. Methylation analysis indicates an opposite epigenetic regulation direction between Chinese and European pig (EU) domestication, which resulted in opposite expression changes in this gene between the two domesticated groups. Our preliminary analyses on DMSs among different pig breeds and ASM imply that imprinting was associated with methylation differences. This study systematically demonstrates the genetic and epigenetic patterns of H19 during pig domestication and provide valuable cues and basis for further research on the function of H19 in pig domestication.",2016,16,87,10.1186/s12862-016-0657-5
167,N,Multigenerational exposure to silver ions and silver nanoparticles reveals heightened sensitivity and epigenetic memory in Caenorhabditis elegans,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"The effects from multigenerational exposures to engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in their pristine and transformed states are currently unknown despite such exposures being an increasingly common scenario in natural environments. Here, we examine how exposure over 10 generations affects the sensitivity of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to pristine and sulfidized Ag ENPs and AgNO3. We also include populations that were initially exposed over six generations but kept unexposed for subsequent four generations to allow recovery from exposure. Toxicity of the different silver forms decreased in the order AgNO3, Ag ENPs and Ag2S ENPs. Continuous exposure to Ag ENPs and AgNO3 caused pronounced sensitization (approx. 10-fold) in the F2 generation, which was sustained until F10. This sensitization was less pronounced for Ag2S ENP exposures, indicating different toxicity mechanisms. Subtle changes in size and lifespan were also measured. In the recovery populations, the sensitivity to Ag ENPs and AgNO3 resulting from the initial multigenerational exposure persisted. Their response sensitivity for all endpoints was most closely related to the last ancestral exposed generation (F5), rather than unexposed controls. The mechanisms of transgenerational transfer of sensitivity are probably organized through the epigenome, and we encourage others to investigate such effects as a priority for mechanistic toxicology.",2016,283,20152911,10.1098 spb.2015.2911
168,N,Nonadditive changes to cytosine methylation as a consequence of hybridization and genome duplication in Senecio (Asteraceae),MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"The merger of two or more divergent genomes within an allopolyploid nucleus can facilitate speciation and adaptive evolution in flowering plants. Widespread changes to gene expression have been shown to result from interspecific hybridisation and polyploidy in a number of plant species, and attention has now shifted to determining the epigenetic processes that drive these changes. We present here an analysis of cytosine methylation patterns in triploid F(1)Senecio (ragwort) hybrids and their allohexaploid derivatives. We observe that, in common with similar studies in Arabidopsis, Spartina and Triticum, a small but significant proportion of loci display nonadditive methylation in the hybrids, largely resulting from interspecific hybridisation. Despite this, genome duplication results in a secondary effect on methylation, with reversion to additivity at some loci and novel methylation status at others. We also observe differences in methylation state between different allopolyploid generations, predominantly in cases of additive methylation with regard to which parental methylation state is dominant. These changes to methylation state in both F-1 triploids and their allohexaploid derivatives largely mirror the overall patterns of nonadditive gene expression observed in our previous microarray analyses and may play a causative role in generating those expression changes. These similar global changes to DNA methylation resulting from hybridisation and genome duplication may serve as a source of epigenetic variation in natural populations, facilitating adaptive evolution. Our observations that methylation state can also vary between different generations of polyploid hybrids suggests that newly formed allopolyploid species may display a high degree of epigenetic diversity upon which natural selection can act.",2011,20,105-113,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04926.x
169,N,The epigenetic footprint of poleward range-expanding plants in apomictic dandelions,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation variation, can generate heritable phenotypic variation independent of the underlying genetic code. However, epigenetic variation in natural plant populations is poorly documented and little understood. Here, we test whether northward range expansion of obligate apomicts of the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is associated with DNA methylation variation. We characterized and compared patterns of genetic and DNA methylation variation in greenhouse-reared offspring of T.officinale that were collected along a latitudinal transect of northward range expansion in Europe. Genetic AFLP and epigenetic MS-AFLP markers revealed high levels of local diversity and modest but significant heritable differentiation between sampling locations and between the southern, central and northern regions of the transect. Patterns of genetic and epigenetic variation were significantly correlated, reflecting the genetic control over epigenetic variation and/or the accumulation of lineage-specific spontaneous epimutations, which may be selectively neutral. In addition, we identified a small component of DNA methylation differentiation along the transect that is independent of genetic variation. This epigenetic differentiation might reflect environment-specific induction or, in case the DNA methylation variation affects relevant traits and fitness, selection of heritable DNA methylation variants. Such generated epigenetic variants might contribute to the adaptive capacity of individual asexual lineages under changing environments. Our results highlight the potential of heritable DNA methylation variation to contribute to population differentiation along ecological gradients. Further studies are needed using higher resolution methods to understand the functional significance of such natural occurring epigenetic differentiation.",2015,24,4406-4418,10.1111/mec.13329

173,N,The methylation landscape and its role in domestication and gene regulation in the chicken,NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,"Domestication is one of the strongest examples of artificial selection and has produced some of the most extreme within-species phenotypic variation known. In the case of the chicken, it has been hypothesized that DNA methylation may play a mechanistic role in the domestication response. By inter-crossing wild-derived red junglefowl with domestic chickens, we mapped quantitative trait loci for hypothalamic methylation (methQTL), gene expression (eQTL) and behaviour. We find large, stable methylation differences, with 6,179cisand 2,973transmethQTL identified. Over 46% of thetranseffects were genotypically controlled by five loci, mainly associated with increased methylation in the junglefowl genotype. In a third of eQTL, we find that there is a correlation between gene expression and methylation, while statistical causality analysis reveals multiple instances where methylation is driving gene expression, as well as the reverse. We also show that methylation is correlated with some aspects of behavioural variation in the inter-cross. In conclusion, our data suggest a role for methylation in the regulation of gene expression underlying the domesticated phenotype of the chicken. Quantitative trait loci mapping of a cross between red junglefowl and domestic chickens provides evidence for the role of methylation in regulating gene expression in the domestication process.",2020,4,1713-1724,10.1038/s41559-020-01310-1

The present study tests this hypothesis using Drosophila immigrans, and proposes a novel approach to help broadly define the epigenetic factors causing such an effect. We first estimated the magnitude of isofemale heritability in sternopleural bristle fluctuating asymmetry (FA), using replicate genetic lines extracted from nature. Positional FA (PFA) exhibited significant among-line variation, and the heritability estimate of 0.10 (0.046 s.e.m.) was statistically significant. Among individual males, there was a significant positive relationship between PFA and copulation latency (time elapsed between introduction of females and copulation) and duration, but not copulation frequency. Moreover, high-DS lines exhibited significantly shorter copulation latency and duration compared with low-DS lines. When these components of sexual performance were again contrasted between lines with among-individual differences in bristle asymmetry controlled statistically, significant line effects on copulation latency and duration disappeared. The results suggest that deficits in the developmental apparatus underlying one particular trait can compromise individual sexual performance, and weaken the hypothesis that FA is a cue of overall 'genetic quality'.",2004,271,1815-1821,10.1098 spb.2004.2786

Yet, our understanding of this relationship can contribute significant knowledge on how and why organisms target specific gene bodies for methylation. Here, we studied gene body methylation patterns in two Daphnia species. We observed both highly methylated genes and genes devoid of methylation in a background of low global methylation levels. A small but highly significant number of genes was highly methylated in both species. Remarkably, functional analyses indicate that variation in methylation within and between Daphnia species is primarily targeted to small gene families whereas large gene families tend to lack variation. The degree of sequence similarity could not explain the observed pattern. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation between gene family size and the degree of methylation suggests that gene body methylation may help regulate gene family expansion and functional diversification of gene families leading to phenotypic variation.",2016,8,1185-1196,10.1093/gbe/evw069

This indicates that organisms' phenotypes may epigenetically reflect their past exposure history as well as reflecting chemicals currently present in their environment. This concept has significant implications for environmental monitoring. However, there is as yet little or no implementation of epigenetics in environmental risk assessment. In a proof-of-principle study we exposed Daphnia magna to 5-azacytidine, a known DNA de-methylating agent. Exposures covered combinations of prenatal and postnatal exposures as well as different exposure durations and recovery stages. Growth, the transcription of genes and levels of metabolites involved in regulating DNA methylation, and methylation levels of several genes were measured. Our data shows that prenatal exposures caused significant changes in the methylome of target genes, indicating that prenatal stages of Daphnia are also susceptible to same level of change as post-natal stages of Daphnia. While the combination of pre- and postnatal exposures caused the most extreme reduction in DNA methylation compared to the control group. Furthermore, some of the changes in the methylation patterns were persistent even after the initial stressor was removed. Our results suggest that epigenetic biomarkers have the potential to be used as indicators of past chemical exposure history of organisms and provide strong support for implementing changes to the current regimes for chemical risk assessment to mimic realistic environmental scenarios.",2018,27,556-568,10.1007/s10646-018-1927-3

They are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists which disrupt the function of insect neurons and cause paralysis and death. In addition to direct mortality, there are numerous sublethal effects of low doses of neonicotinoids on bees. We hypothesize that some of these large array of effects could be a consequence of epigenetic changes in bees induced by neonicotinoids. We compared whole methylome (BS-seal) and RNA-seal libraries of the brains of buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers exposed to field-realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid to libraries from control workers.

1014,N,Germ line Methylation Patterns Determine the Distribution of Recombination Events in the Dog Genome,Genome Biology and Evolution,"The positive-regulatory domain containing nine gene, PROMO, which strongly associates with the location of recombination events in several vertebrates, is inferred to be inactive in the dog genome. Here, we address several questions regarding the control of recombination and its influence on genome evolution in dogs. First, we address whether the association between CpG islands (CGIs) and recombination hotspots is generated by lack of methylation, GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), or both. Using a genome-wide dog single nucleotide polymorphism data set and comparisons of the dog genome with related species, we show that recombination-associated CGIs have low CpG mutation rates, and that CpG mutation rate is negatively correlated with recombination rate genome wide, indicating that nonmethylation attracts the recombination machinery. We next use a neighbor-dependent model of nucleotide substitution to disentangle the effects of CpG mutability and gBGC and analyze the effects that loss of PROMO has on these rates. We infer that methylation patterns have been stable during canid genome evolution, but that dog CGIs have experienced a drastic increase in substitution rate due to gBGC, consistent with increased levels of recombination in these regions. We also show that gBGC is likely to have generated many new CGIs in the dog genome, but these mostly occur away from genes, whereas the number of C GIs in gene promoter regions has not increased greatly in recent evolutionary history. Recombination has a major impact on the distribution of CGIs that are detected in the dog genome due to the interaction between methylation and gBGC. The results indicate that germline methylation patterns are the main determinant of recombination rates in the absence of PRDM9.",2015,7,522-530,10.1093/gbe/evu282
1015,N,Diversity of cytosine methylation across the fungal tree of life,Nature Ecology & Evolution,"The generation of thousands of fungal genomes is leading to a better understanding of genes and genomic organization within the kingdom. However, the epigenome, which includes DNA and chromatin modifications, remains poorly investigated in fungi. Large comparative studies in animals and plants have deepened our understanding of epigenomic variation, particularly of the modified base 5-methylcytosine (5mC), but taxonomic sampling of disparate groups is needed to develop unifying explanations for 5mC variation. Here, we utilize the largest phylogenetic resolution of 5mC methyltransferases (5mC MTases) and genome evolution to better understand levels and patterns of 5mC across fungi. We show that extant 5mC MTase genotypes are descendent from ancestral maintenance and de novo genotypes, whereas the 5mC MTases DIM-2 and RID are more recently derived, and that 5mC levels are correlated with 5mC MTase genotype and transposon content. Our survey also revealed that fungi lack canonical gene-body methylation, which distinguishes fungal epigenomes from certain insect and plant species. However, some fungal species possess independently derived clusters of contiguous 5mC encompassing many genes. In some cases, DNA repair pathways and the N-6-methyladenine DNA modification negatively coevolved with 5mC pathways, which additionally contributed to interspecific epigenomic variation across fungi.",2019,3,479-,10.1038/s41559-019-0810-9
1016,N,Evolution of DNA Methylation across Insects,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"DNA methylation contributes to gene and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, and therefore has been hypothesized to facilitate the evolution of plastic traits such as sociality in insects. However, DNA methylation is sparsely studied in insects. Therefore, we documented patterns of DNA methylation across a wide diversity of insects. We predicted that underlying enzymatic machinery is concordant with patterns of DNA methylation. Finally, given the suggestion that DNA methylation facilitated social evolution in Hymenoptera, we tested the hypothesis that the DNA methylation system will be associated with presence/absence of sociality among other insect orders. We found DNA methylation to be widespread, detected in all orders examined except Diptera (flies). Whole genome bisulfite sequencing showed that orders differed in levels of DNA methylation. Hymenopteran (ants, bees, wasps and sawflies) had some of the lowest levels, including several potential losses. Blattodea (cockroaches and termites) show all possible patterns, including a potential loss of DNA methylation in a eusocial species whereas solitary species had the highest levels. Species with DNA methylation do not always possess the typical enzymatic machinery. We identified a gene duplication event in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that is shared by some Hymenoptera, and paralogs have experienced divergent, nonneutral evolution. This diversity and nonneutral evolution of underlying machinery suggests alternative DNA methylation pathways may exist. Phylogenetically corrected comparisons revealed no evidence that supports evolutionary association between sociality and DNA methylation.

1019,N,MHM assay: molecular sexing based on the sex-specific methylation pattern of the MHM region in chickens,Conservation Genetics,"Bird sex determination using molecular methods has proved to be a valuable tool in different studies. Although it is possible to sex most birds by coupling the CHD assay with others available methods, no sex-determining gene like SRY in mammalians has been identified in birds. The male hypermethylated (MHM) region on the Z chromosome has been found to be hypermethylated in males and hypomethylated in females in birds of the order Galliformes. We analyzed the DNA from feathers of 50 adult chickens to verify the methylation pattern of the MHM region by PCR and the restriction enzyme HpaII (a method named MHM assay). The results, visualized in agarose gel, were compared with PCR amplification of the CHD-Z and CHD-W genes (polyacrylamide gel) and with the birds' phenotype. All males (25) showed hypermethylation of the MHM region, and all females (25) showed hypomethylation. The sexing by MHM assay was in according with phenotype and CHD sexing. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses the MHM region for sexing birds. Although the real role of the MHM region in the sex determination is still unclear, this could be a universal marker for sexing birds and may be involved in sex determination by its influence on transcriptional processes. The MHM assay could be a good alternative for CHD assay in developmental studies.",2008,9,985-987,10.1007/s10592-007-9423-y
1020,N,DNA Methylation Rebalances Gene Dosage after Mammalian Gene Duplications,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"Although gene duplication plays a major role in organismal evolution, it may also lead to gene dosage imbalance, thereby having an immediate adverse effect on an organism's fitness. Investigating the evolution of the expression patterns of genes that duplicated after the divergence of rodents and primates, we confirm that adaptive evolution has been involved in dosage rebalance after gene duplication. To understand mechanisms underlying this process, we examined 1) microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation, 2) cis-regulatory sequence modifications, and 3) DNA methylation. Neither miRNA-mediated regulation nor cis-regulatory changes was found to be associated with expression reduction of duplicate genes. By contrast, duplicate genes, especially lowly expressed copies, were heavily methylated in the upstream region. However, for duplicate genes encoding proteins that are members of macromolecular complexes, heavy methylation in the genic region was not consistently observed. This result held after controlling potential confounding factors, such as enrichment in functional categories. Our results suggest that during mammalian evolution, DNA methylation plays a dominant role in dosage rebalance after gene duplication by inhibiting transcription initiation of duplicate genes.",2012,29,133-144,10.1093/molbev/msr174

1022,N,"The evolution of the coding exome of the Arabidopsis species - the influences of DNA methylation, relative exon position, and exon length",BMC Evolutionary Biology,"Background: The evolution of the coding exome is a major driving force of functional divergence both between species and between protein isoforms. Exons at different positions in the transcript or in different transcript isoforms may (1) mutate at different rates due to variations in DNA methylation level; and (2) serve distinct biological roles, and thus be differentially targeted by natural selection. Furthermore, intrinsic exonic features, such as exon length, may also affect the evolution of individual exons. Importantly, the evolutionary effects of these intrinsic/extrinsic features may differ significantly between animals and plants. Such inter-lineage differences, however, have not been systematically examined. Results: Here we examine how DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides (CpG methylation), in the context of intrinsic exonic features (exon length and relative exon position in the transcript), influences the evolution of coding exons of Arabidopsis thaliana. We observed fairly different evolutionary patterns in A. thaliana as compared with those reported for animals. Firstly, the mutagenic effect of CpG methylation is the strongest for internal exons and the weakest for first exons despite the stringent selective constraints on the former group. Secondly, the mutagenic effect of CpG methylation increases significantly with length in first exons but not in the other two exon groups. Thirdly, CpG methylation level is correlated with evolutionary rates (d(S), d(N), and the d(N)/d(S) ratio) with markedly different patterns among the three exon groups. The correlations are generally positive, negative, and mixed for first, last, and internal exons, respectively. Fourthly, exon length is a CpG methylation-independent indicator of evolutionary rates, particularly for d(N) and the d(N)/d(S) ratio in last and internal exons. Finally, the evolutionary patterns of coding exons with regard to CpG methylation differ significantly between Arabidopsis species and mammals. Conclusions: Our results suggest that intrinsic features, including relative exonic position in the transcript and exon length, play an important role in the evolution of A. thaliana coding exons. Furthermore, CpG methylation is correlated with exonic evolutionary rates differentially between A. thaliana and animals, and may have served different biological roles in the two lineages.",2014,14,145,10.1186/1471-2148-14-145
1023,N,Genome assembly and methylome analysis of the white wax scale insect provides insight into sexual differentiation of metamorphosis in hexapods,Molecular Ecology Resources,"Scale insects are hemimetabolous, showing incomplete metamorphosis and no true pupal stage. Ericerus pela, commonly known as the white wax scale insect (hereafter, WWS), is a wax-producing insect found in Asia and Europe. WWS displays dramatic sexual dimorphism, with notably different metamorphic fates in males and females. Males develop into winged adults, while females are neotenic and maintain a nymph-like appearance, which are flightless and remain stationary. Here, we report the de novo assembly of the WWS genome with a size of 638.30 Mbp (69.68 Mbp for scaffold N50) by PacBio sequencing and Hi-C. These data allowed us to perform a robust phylogenetic analysis comprising 24,923 gene orthogroups from 16 representative insect genomes. This analysis indicated that holometabola evolved from insects with incomplete metamorphosis in the Late Carboniferous, about 50 million years earlier than previously thought. To study the distinct developmental fates of males and females, we analysed the methylome landscape in either sex. Surprisingly, WWS displayed high methylation levels (4.42% for males) when compared to other insects. We observed differential methylation patterns in males and females for genes involved in steroid and sesquiterpenoid production as well as genes acting in fatty acid metabolism pathways. We measured titre profiles for ecdysone, the principal insect steroid hormone, and juvenile hormone (a sesquiterpenoid) in both males and females, which suggested that these hormones are the primary drivers of sexually dimorphic development. Our results provide a comprehensive genomic and epigenomic resource of scale insects that provide new insights into the evolution of metamorphosis and sexual dimorphism in insects.",,,,10.1111/1755-0998.13376
1024,N,Evolutionary Epigenomics of Retrotransposon-Mediated Methylation Spreading in Rice,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"Plant genomes contain numerous transposable elements (TEs), and many hypotheses on the evolutionary drivers that restrict TE activity have been postulated. Few models, however, have focused on the evolutionary epigenomic interaction between the plant host and its TE. The host genome recruits epigenetic factors, such as methylation, to silence TEs but methylation can spread beyond the TE sequence and influence the expression of nearby host genes. In this study, we investigated this epigenetic trade-off between TE and proximal host gene silencing by studying the epigenomic regulation of repressing long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (RTs) in Oryza sativa. Results showed significant evidence of methylation spreading originating from the LTR-RT sequences, and the extent of spreading was dependent on five factors: 1) LTR-RT family, 2) time since the LTR-RT insertion, 3) recombination rate of the LTR-RT region, 4) level of LTR-RT sequence methylation, and 5) chromosomal location. Methylation spreading had negative effects by reducing host gene expression, but only on host genes with LTR-RT inserted in its introns. Our results also suggested high levels of LTR-RT methylationmight have a role in suppressing TE-mediated deleterious ectopic recombination. In the end, despite the methylation spreading, no strong epigenetic trade-off was detected and majority of LTR-RT may have only minor epigenetic effects on nearby host genes.",2018,35,365-382,10.1093/molbev/msx284
1025,N,DNA Methylation is Associated with an Increased Level of Conservation at Nondegenerate Nucleotides in Mammals,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides can significantly increase the rate of cytosine-to-thymine mutations and the level of sequence divergence. Although the correlations between DNA methylation and genomic sequence evolution have been widely studied, an unaddressed yet fundamental question is how DNA methylation is associated with the conservation of individual nucleotides in different sequence contexts. Here, we demonstrate that in mammalian exons, the correlations between DNA methylation and the conservation of individual nucleotides are dependent on the type of exonic sequence (coding or untranslated), the degeneracy of coding nucleotides, background selection pressure, and the relative position (first or nonfirst exon in the transcript) where the nucleotides are located. For untranslated and nonzero-fold degenerate nucleotides, methylated sites are less conserved than unmethylated sites regardless of background selection pressure and the relative position of the exon. For zero-fold degenerate (or nondegenerate) nucleotides, however, the reverse trend is observed in nonfirst coding exons and first coding exons that are under stringent background selection pressure. Furthermore, cytosine-to-thymine mutations at methylated zero-fold degenerate nucleotides are predicted to be more detrimental than those that occur at unmethylated nucleotides. As zero-fold and nonzero-fold degenerate nucleotides are very close to each other, our results suggest that the functional resolution of DNA methylation may be finer than previously recognized. In addition, the positive correlation between CpG methylation and the level of conservation at zero-fold degenerate nucleotides implies that CpG methylation may serve as an indicator of functional importance of these nucleotides.",2014,31,387-396,10.1093/molbev/mst208
1026,N,Genetic and epigenetic studies on populations of Deschampsia antarctica Desv. from contrasting environments on King George Island,Polish Polar Research,"Populations of Antarctic hairgrass Deschampsia antarctica Desv. from King George Island exhibit variation in many traits. The reason for that is not evident and could be addressed to variable environmental conditions. Obviously, phenotypic variation could be due to stable or temporal changes in expression pattern as the result of adaptation. Stable changes could be due to mutations or site DNA methylation variation that modified expression pattern. Recently, metAFLP approach was proposed to study such effects. A variant of methylation sensitive AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism), based on the isoschizomeric combinations Acc65I/MseI and KpnI/MseI was applied to analyze the sequence and site DNA methylation differences between two D. antarctica populations exhibiting morphological dissimilarities. Both DNA sequence mutations and site methylation pattern alternations were detected among and within analyzed populations. It is assumed that such changes might have originated as the response to environmental conditions that induced site methylation alternations leading to phenotypic variation of D. antarctica populations from South Shetland Islands.",2011,32,15-26,10.2478/v10183-011-0005-9

Here we test whether DNA methylation influences patterns of adaptive sex allocation in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Female N. vitripennis allocate offspring sex broadly in line with local mate competition (LMC) theory. However, recent theory has highlighted how genomic conflict may influence sex allocation under LMC, conflict that requires parent-of-origin information to be retained by alleles through some form of epigenetic signal. We manipulated whole-genome DNA methylation in N. vitripennis females using the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Across two replicated experiments, we show that disruption of DNA methylation does not ablate the facultative sex allocation response of females, as sex ratios still vary with cofoundress number as in the classical theory. However, sex ratios are generally shifted upward when DNA methylation is disrupted. Our data are consistent with predictions from genomic conflict over sex allocation theory and suggest that sex ratios may be closer to the optimum for maternally inherited alleles.",2015,186,513-518,10.1086/682950
1030,N,THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DINUCLEOTIDE CPG AND CYTOSINE METHYLATION IN THE VITELLOGENIN GENE FAMILY,Journal of Molecular Evolution,"Sequence data from regions of five vertebrate vitellogenin genes were used to examine the frequency, distribution, and mutability of the dinucleotide CpG, the preferred modification site for eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases. The observed level of the CpG dinucleotide in all five genes was markedly lower than that expected from the known mononucleotide frequencies. CpG suppression was greater in introns than in exons. CpG-containing codons were found to be avoided in the vitellogenin genes, but not completely despite the redundancy of the genetic code. Frequency and distribution patterns of this dinucleotide varied dramatically among these otherwise closely related genes. Dense clusters of CpG dinucleotides tended to appear in regions of either functional or structural interest (e.g., in the transposon-like Vi-element ofXenopus) and these clusters contained 5-methylcytosine (5 mC). 5 mC is known to undergo deamination to form thymidine, but the extent to which this transition occurs in the heavily methylated genomes of vertebrates and its contribution to CpG suppression are still unclear. Sequence comparison of the methylated vitellogenin gene regions identified C→T and G→A substitutions that were found to occur at relatively high frequencies. The predicted products of CpG deamination, TpG and CpA, were elevated. These findings are consistent with the view that CpG distribution and methylation are interdependent and that deamination of 5 mC plays an important role in promoting evolutionary change at the nucleotide sequence level.",1987,25,107-115,10.1007/BF02101752

For example, complex social behavior in insects has been investigated primarily with eusocial lineages, nearly all of which are Hymenoptera. If conserved genomic influences on sociality do exist, we need data from a wider range of taxa that also vary in their levels of sociality. Here, we present the assembled and annotated genome of the subsocial beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, a species long used to investigate evolutionary questions of complex social behavior. We used this genome to address two questions. First, do aspects of life history, such as using a carcass to breed, predict overlap in gene models more strongly than phylogeny? We found that the overlap in gene models was similar between N. vespilloides and all other insect groups regardless of life history. Second, like other insects with highly developed social behavior but unlike other beetles, does N. vespilloides have DNA methylation? We found strong evidence for an active DNA methylation system. The distribution of methylation was similar to other insects with exons having the most methylated C pGs. Methylation status appears highly conserved; 85% of the methylated genes in N. vespilloides are also methylated in the hymentopteran Nasonia vitripennis. The addition of this genome adds a coleopteran resource to answer questions about the evolution and mechanistic basis of sociality and to address questions about the potential role of methylation in social behavior.",2015,7,3383-3396,10.1093/gbe/evv194

However, here we report that a sponge, proposed as the potential sister group to the rest of animals, has a highly methylated genome. Despite major differences in genome size and architecture, we find similarities between the independent acquisitions of the hypermethylated state. Both lineages show genome-wide CpG depletion, conserved strong transcription factor methyl-sensitivity and developmental methylation dynamics at 5-hydroxymethylcytosine enriched regions. Together, our findings trace back patterns associated with DNA methylation in vertebrates to the early steps of animal evolution. Thus, the sponge methylome challenges previous hypotheses concerning the uniqueness of vertebrate genome hypermethylation and its implications for regulatory complexity.",2019,3,1464-1473,10.1038/s41559-019-0983-2
1037,N,The emergence of the brain non-CpG methylation system in vertebrates,Nature Ecology & Evolution,"By studying brain DNA methylation across 13 distantly related animals, the authors show that non-CpG DNA methylation, which plays a regulatory role in cognition, is restricted to vertebrates and was assembled at the origin of the vertebrate lineage as a result of the ancestral vertebrate whole-genome duplication. Mammalian brains feature exceptionally high levels of non-CpG DNA methylation alongside the canonical form of CpG methylation. Non-CpG methylation plays a critical regulatory role in cognitive function, which is mediated by the binding of MeCP2, the transcriptional regulator that when mutated causes Rett syndrome. However, it is unclear whether the non-CpG neural methylation system is restricted to mammalian species with complex cognitive abilities or has deeper evolutionary origins. To test this, we investigated brain DNA methylation across 12 distantly related animal lineages, revealing that non-CpG methylation is restricted to vertebrates. We discovered that in vertebrates, non-CpG methylation is enriched within a highly conserved set of developmental genes transcriptionally repressed in adult brains, indicating that it demarcates a deeply conserved regulatory program. We also found that the writer of non-CpG methylation, DNMT3A, and the reader, MeCP2, originated at the onset of vertebrates as a result of the ancestral vertebrate whole-genome duplication. Together, we demonstrate how this novel layer of epigenetic information assembled at the root of vertebrates and gained new regulatory roles independent of the ancestral form of the canonical CpG methylation. This suggests that the emergence of non-CpG methylation may have fostered the evolution of sophisticated cognitive abilities found in the vertebrate lineage.",2021,5,,10.1038/s41559-020-01371-2

Aberrations in placental DNA methylation are linked to several disease states, including intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia. Studying the evolution and development of the placental epigenome is critical to understanding the origin and progression of such diseases. Although high-resolution studies have found substantial variation between placental methylomes of different species, the nature of methylome variation has yet to be characterized within any individual species. We conducted a study of placental DNA methylation at high resolution in multiple strains and closely related species of house mice (Mus musculus musculus, Mus m. domesticus, and M. spretus), across developmental timepoints (embryonic days 15-18), and between two distinct layers (labyrinthine transport and junctional endocrine). We observed substantial genome-wide methylation heterogeneity in mouse placenta compared with other differentiated tissues. Species-specific methylation profiles were concentrated in retrotransposon subfamilies, specifically RLTR10 and RLTR20 subfamilies. Regulatory regions such as gene promoters and CpG islands displayed cross-species conservation, but showed strong differences between layers and developmental timepoints. Partially methylated domains exist in the mouse placenta and widen during development. Taken together, our results characterize the mouse placental methylome as a highly heterogeneous and deregulated landscape globally, intermixed with actively regulated promoter and retrotransposon sequences.",2017,34,1702-1712,10.1093/molbev/msx112

Because it can be influenced by the environment, DNA methylation may contribute to the ability of organisms to acclimatize and adapt to environmental change. We evaluated the distribution of gene body methylation in reef-building corals, a group of organisms facing significant environmental threats. Gene body methylation in six species of corals was inferred from in silico transcriptome analysis of CpG O/E, an estimate of germline DNA methylation that is highly correlated with patterns of methylation enrichment. Consistent with what has been documented in most other invertebrates, all corals exhibited bimodal distributions of germline methylation suggestive of distinct fractions of genes with high and low levels of methylation. The hypermethylated fractions were enriched with genes with housekeeping functions, while genes with inducible functions were highly represented in the hypomethylated fractions. High transcript abundance was associated with intermediate levels of methylation. In three of the coral species, we found that genes differentially expressed in response to thermal stress and ocean acidification exhibited significantly lower levels of methylation. These results support a link between gene body hypomethylation and transcriptional plasticity that may point to a role of DNA methylation in the response of corals to environmental change.",2016,25,1895-1904,10.1111/mec.13414

The occurrence of gbM within protein-coding sequences is particularly puzzling, because methylation causes cytosine hypermutability and hence is likely to produce deleterious amino acid substitutions. We investigate this enigma using an evolutionarily basal group of Metazoa, the stony corals (order Scleractinia, class Anthozoa, phylum Cnidaria). We show that patterns of coral gbM are similar to other invertebrate species, predicting wide and active transcription and slower sequence evolution. We also find a strong correlation between gbM and codon bias, resulting from systematic replacement of CpG bearing codons. We conclude that gbM has strong effects on codon evolution and speculate that this may influence establishment of optimal codons.",2016,33,2285-2293,10.1093/molbev/msw100

The evolution of duplicated genes may be influenced by epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, which affects gene function in some taxa. However, the manner in which DNA methylation affects duplicated genes is not well understood. We studied duplicated genes in the honeybee Apis mellifera, an insect with a highly sophisticated social structure, to investigate whether DNA methylation was associated with gene duplication and genic evolution. We found that levels of gene bodymethylation were significantly lower in duplicate genes than in single-copy genes, implicating a possible role of DNA methylation in postduplication gene maintenance. Additionally, we discovered associations of gene body methylation with the location, length, and time since divergence of paralogous genes. We also found that divergence in DNA methylation was associated with divergence in gene expression in paralogs, although the relationship was not completely consistent with a direct link between DNA methylation and gene expression.

By analyzing several chordate genomes separated for hundreds of millions of years, here we show that the divide between low CpG and high CpG promoters is conserved in several distantly related vertebrate taxa (including human, chicken, frog, lizard, and fish) but not in close invertebrate outgroups (sea squirts). Furthermore, LCG and HCG promoters are distinctively associated with tissue-specific and broadly expressed genes in these distantly related vertebrate taxa. Our results indicate that the function of DNA methylation on gene expression is conserved across these vertebrate taxa and suggest that the 2 classes of promoters have evolved early in vertebrate evolution, as a consequence of the advent of global DNA methylation.",2008,25,1602-1608,10.1093/molbev/msn110

1046,N,Biomarker development for external CO2 injury prediction in apples through exploration of both transcriptome and DNA methylation changes,AOB Plants,"Several apple cultivars are susceptible to CO2 injury, a physiological disorder that can be expressed either externally or internally, and which can cause major losses of fruit during controlled atmosphere (CA) storage. Disorder development can also be enhanced using SmartFresh (TM) technology, based on the inhibition of ethylene perception by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). Injury development is associated with less mature fruit with lower ethylene production, but the aetiology of the disorder is poorly understood. Here we report on the progress made using mRNAseq approaches to explore the transcriptome during the development of external CO2 injury. Next-generation sequencing was used to mine the apple transcriptome for gene expression changes that are associated with the development of external CO2 injury. 'Empire' apples from a single orchard were treated with either 1 mu L L-1 1-MCP or 1 g L-1 diphenylamine or left untreated, and then stored in a CA of 5 kPa CO2 and 2 kPa O-2. In addition, susceptibility to the disorder in the 'Empire' apples from five different orchards was investigated and the methylation state of the ACS1 promoter investigated using McrBC endonuclease digestion and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression of over 30 000 genes, aligned to the apple genome, was monitored, with clear divergence of expression among treatments after 1 day of CA storage. Symptom development, internal ethylene concentrations (IECs) and methylation state of the ACS1 promoter were different for each of five orchards. With transcriptomic changes affected by treatment, this dataset will be useful in discovering biomarkers that assess disorder susceptibility. An inverse correlation between the frequency of this disorder and the IEC was detected in a multiple orchard trial. Differential methylation state of the ACS1 promoter correlated with both IEC and injury occurrence, indicating epigenetic regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and possibly events leading to disorder development.",2013,5,plt021,10.1093/aobpla/plt021

Using the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), a powerful model for the analysis of insect evolution and development, we conducted a genome-wide comparative analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation in caterpillars and adults to determine whether complete metamorphosis has an epigenetic basis in this species. Bisulfite sequencing indicated a generally low level of DNA methylation with a unimodal CpG(O/E) distribution. Expression analysis revealed that 24 % of all known M. sexta genes (3.729) were upregulated in last-instar larvae relative to the adult moth, whereas 26 % (4.077) were downregulated. We also identified 4.946 loci and 4.960 regions showing stage-specific differential methylation. Interestingly, genes encoding histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases were differentially methylated in the larvae and adults, indicating there is crosstalk between different epigenetic mechanisms. The distinct sets of methylated genes in M. sexta larvae and adults suggest that complete metamorphosis involves epigenetic modifications associated with profound transcriptional reprogramming, involving approximately half of all the genes in this species.",2021,9,646281,10.3389/fevo.2021.646281

1049,N,Variation in DNA Methylation Is Not Consistently Reflectedby Sociality in Hymenoptera,Genome Biology and Evolution,"Changes in gene regulation that underlie phenotypic evolution can be encoded directly in the DNA sequence or mediated by chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation. It has been hypothesized that the evolution of eusocial division of labor is associated with enhanced gene regulatory potential, which may include expansions in DNA methylation in the genomes of Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps, and sawflies). Recently, this hypothesis garnered support from analyses of a commonly used metric to estimate DNA methylation in silico, CpG content. Here, we test this hypothesis using direct, nucleotide-level measures of DNA methylation across nine species of Hymenoptera. In doing so, we generated new DNA methylomes for three species of interest, including one solitary and one facultatively eusocial halictid bee and a sawfly. We demonstrate that the strength of correlation between CpG content and DNA methylation varies widely among hymenopteran taxa, highlighting shortcomings in the utility of CpG content as a proxy for DNA methylation in comparative studies of taxa with sparse DNA methylomes. We observed strikingly high levels of DNA methylation in the sawfly relative to other investigated hymenopterans. Analyses of molecular evolution suggest the relatively distinct sawfly DNA methylome may be associated with positive selection on functional DNMT3 domains. Sawflies are an outgroup to all ants, bees, and wasps, and no sawfly species are eusocial. We find no evidence that either global expansions or variation within individual ortholog groups in DNA methylation are consistently associated with the evolution of social behavior.",2017,9,1687-1698,10.1093/gbe/evx128
1050,N,DNA Methylation and Chromatin Organization in Insects: Insights from the Ant Camponotus floridanus,Genome Biology and Evolution,"Epigenetic information regulates gene function and has important effects on development in eukaryotic organisms. DNA methylation, one such form of epigenetic information, has been implicated in the regulation of gene function in diverse metazoan taxa. In insects, DNA methylation has been shown to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and splicing. However, the functional basis for this role remains relatively poorly understood, and other epigenetic systems likely interact with DNA methylation to affect gene expression. We investigated associations between DNA methylation and histone modifications in the genome of the ant Camponotus floridanus in order to provide insight into how different epigenetic systems interact to affect gene function. We found that many histone modifications are strongly predictive of DNA methylation levels in genes, and that these epigenetic signals are more predictive of gene expression when considered together than when considered independently. We also found that peaks of DNA methylation are associated with the spatial organization of chromatin within active genes. Finally, we compared patterns of differential histone modification enrichment to patterns of differential DNA methylation to reveal that several histone modifications significantly covary with DNA methylation between C. floridanus phenotypes. As the first genomic comparison of DNA methylation to histone modifications within a single insect taxon, our investigation provides new insight into the regulatory significance of DNA methylation.",2015,7,931-942,10.1093/gbe/evv039
1051,N,Epigenetic inheritance and genome regulation: is DNA methylation linked to ploidy in haplodiploid insects?,Proceedings of the Royal Soceity B-Biological Sciences,"Organisms show great variation in ploidy level. For example, chromosome copy number varies among cells, individuals and species. One particularly widespread example of ploidy variation is found in haplodiploid taxa, wherein males are typically haploid and females are typically diploid. Despite the prevalence of haplodiploidy, the regulatory consequences of having separate haploid and diploid genomes are poorly understood. In particular, it remains unknown whether epigenetic mechanisms contribute to regulatory compensation for genome dosage. To gain greater insights into the importance of epigenetic information to ploidy compensation, we examined DNA methylation differences among diploid queen, diploid worker, haploid male and diploid male Solenopsis invicta fire ants. Surprisingly, we found that morphologically dissimilar diploid males, queens and workers were more similar to one another in terms of DNA methylation than were morphologically similar haploid and diploid males. Moreover, methylation level was positively associated with gene expression for genes that were differentially methylated in haploid and diploid castes. These data demonstrate that intragenic DNA methylation levels differ among individuals of distinct ploidy and are positively associated with levels of gene expression. Thus, these results suggest that epigenetic information may be linked to ploidy compensation in haplodiploid insects. Overall, this study suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may be important to maintaining appropriate patterns of gene regulation in biological systems that differ in genome copy number.",2014,281,20140411,10.1098 spb.2014.0411

We investigated the proposal that lack of dimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me2) is not restricted to Z. dumosum, but a feature uniquely evolved in the Zygophyllaceae. To this end, we analyzed the state of H3K9me2 in various species including Z. simplex (annual), Peganum harmala (hemicryptophyte), Nitraria retusa (shrub) and Balanites aegyptiaca (tree) from the Negev Desert (Israel) and Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), a prominent species in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts of western North America. All but one of these plants showed dimethylation of H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2), but no detectable levels of H3K9me2. The exception was Nitraria retusa, recently separated from the Zygophyllaceae family, which possesses H3K9me2, further supporting its partition into a distinct family (Nitrariaceae). Interestingly, the analysis of Krameria cistoidea (Krameriaceae), which is listed under the Zygophyllales, showed the presence of H3K9me2. It appears that lack of H3K9me2 has uniquely evolved in the Zygophyllaceae (sensu stricto), suggesting that this phenomenon has a strong genetic background.

LUMA depends on digestion of DNA with methyl-sensitive and methyl-insensitive restriction enzymes, followed by pyrosequencing. Until recently, LUMA has been principally used for biomedical research. Here, we use chickens as a model to investigate sample quality issues relating to LUMA and then apply the method to ecological species. First, we assessed the effect of tissue storage conditions on DNA methylation values. This is an important consideration for ecological species because samples are not always ideally preserved and LUMA is sensitive to poor DNA quality. We found that good quality LUMA data could be obtained from chicken liver and brain tissues stored at 21 degrees C for at least 2 and 12 h, respectively. Longer storage times introduced nonspecific peaks to pyrograms which were associated with reduced DNA methylation. Repeatedly, freezing and thawing the tissues did not affect LUMA data. Second, we measured DNA methylation in 12 species representing five animal classes: amphibians (African and Western clawed frog), reptiles (green anole lizard), fish (yellow perch, goldfish, lake trout), mammals (American mink, polar bear, short-beaked common dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin) and birds (chicken, Japanese quail). We saw a pattern of high DNA methylation in fish (84-87%), and intermediate levels in mammals (68-72%) and birds (52-71%). This pattern corresponds well with previous measures of DNA methylation generated by HPLC.

This is surprising, as colonization is usually associated with reduced genetic variation. Heritable phenotypic variation with an epigenetic basis may explain this paradox. Here, we assessed the contribution of DNA methylation to local adaptation in native and naturalized non-native ruderal plant species in Germany. We reciprocally transplanted offspring from natural populations of seven native and five non-native plant species between the Konstanz region in the south and the Potsdam region in the north of Germany. Before the transplant, half of the seeds were treated with the demethylation agent zebularine. We recorded survival, flowering probability, and biomass production as fitness estimates. Contrary to our expectations, we found little evidence for local adaptation, both among the native and among the non-native plant species. Zebularine treatment had mostly negative effects on overall plant performance, regardless of whether plants were local or not, and regardless of whether they were native or non-native. Synthesis. We conclude that local adaptation, at least at the scale of our study, plays no major role in the success of non-native and native ruderal plants.

1061,N,Single-cell expression noise and gene-body methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana,Heredity,"Gene-body methylation (gbM) refers to an increased level of methylated cytosines specifically in a CG sequence context within genes. gbM is found in plant genes with intermediate expression level, which evolve slowly, and is often broadly conserved across millions of years of evolution. Intriguingly however, some plants lack gbM, and thus it remains unclear whether gbM has a function. In animals, there is support for a role of gbM in reducing erroneous transcription and transcription noise, but so far most studies in plants have tested for an effect of gbM on expression level, not noise. Here, we therefore tested whether gbM was associated with reduced expression noise in Arabidopsis thaliana, using single-cell transcriptome sequencing data from root quiescent centre cells. We find that gbM genes have lower expression noise levels than unmethylated genes. However, an analysis of covariance revealed that, if other genomic features are taken into account, this association disappears. Nonetheless, gbM genes were more consistently expressed across single-cell samples, supporting previous inference that gbM genes are constitutively expressed. Finally, we observed that fewer RNAseq reads map to introns of gbM genes than to introns of unmethylated genes, which indicates that gbM might be involved in reducing erroneous transcription by reducing intron retention.",2019,123,81-91,10.1038/s41437-018-0181-z

While most evo-devo studies focus on the genetic underpinnings of adaptive phenotypic variation, factors beyond changes in nucleotide sequence can also play a major role in shaping developmental outcomes. Here, we document a vigorous but enigmatic gaping behaviour during the early development of Lake Malawi cichlid larvae. The onset of the behaviour precedes the formation of bone, and we predicted that it might influence craniofacial shape by affecting the mechanical environment in which bone develops. Consistent with this, we found that both natural variation and experimental manipulation of this behaviour induced differential skeletal development that foreshadows adaptive variation in adult trophic morphology. In fact, the magnitude of difference in skeletal morphology induced by these simple shifts in behaviour was similar to those predicted to be caused by genetic factors. Finally, we demonstrate that this mechanical-load-induced shift in skeletal development is associated with differences in ptch1 expression, a gene previously implicated in mediating between-species differences in skeletal shape.

However, like most mutations, a newly duplicated gene is often deleterious and removed from the genome by drift or natural selection. The early molecular changes that occur soon after duplication therefore may influence the long-term survival of gene duplicates, but relatively little empirical data exist on the events near the onset of duplication before mutations have time to accumulate. In this study, we contrast gene expression and DNA methylation levels of duplicate genes in the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, including recently emerged duplications that segregate as copy number variations (CNVs). We find that younger duplicate genes have higher levels of promoter methylation than older genes, and that gene CNVs have higher promoter methylation than non-CNVs. These results suggest preferential duplication of highly methylated genes or rapid methylation changes soon after duplication. We also find a negative association between methylation and expression, providing a putative role for methylation in suppressing transcription that compensates for increases in gene copy numbers and promoting paralog retention. We propose that methylation contributes to the longevity of young duplicate genes, extending the window of opportunity for functional divergence via mutation.",2021,75,706-718,10.1111/evo.14184
1065,N,Functional Conservation of DNA Methylation in the Pea Aphid and the Honeybee,Genome Biology and Evolution,"DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark known to have wide-ranging effects on gene regulation in a variety of animal taxa. Comparative genomic analyses can help elucidate the function of DNA methylation by identifying conserved features of methylated genes and other genomic regions. In this study, we used computational approaches to distinguish genes marked by heavy methylation from those marked by little or no methylation in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. We investigated if these two classes had distinct evolutionary histories and functional roles by conducting comparative analysis with the honeybee, Apis (Ap.) mellifera. We found that highly methylated orthologs in A. pisum and Ap. mellifera exhibited greater conservation of methylation status, suggesting that highly methylated genes in ancestral species may remain highly methylated over time. We also found that methylated genes tended to show different rates of evolution than unmethylated genes. In addition, genes targeted by methylation were enriched for particular biological processes that differed from those in relatively unmethylated genes. Finally, methylated genes were preferentially ubiquitously expressed among alternate phenotypes in both species, whereas genes lacking signatures of methylation were preferentially associated with condition-specific gene expression. Overall, our analyses support a conserved role for DNA methylation in insects with comparable methylation systems.",2010,2,719-728,10.1093/gbe/evq057
1066,N,Patterning and Regulatory Associations of DNA Methylation Are Mirrored by Histone Modifications in Insects,Genome Biology and Evolution,"Epigenetic information is an important mediator of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in eukaryotic organisms. One of the most important and widely conserved forms of epigenetic information is the methylation of genes. However, the function of intragenic DNA methylation remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to gain greater understanding of the nature of intragenic methylation by determining its role in the multilayered epigenetic landscape of insects. We first investigated the evolutionary lability of DNA methylation by examining whether methylation patterns were conserved in the fire ant and honey bee. We found that DNA methylation was targeted to largely overlapping sets of orthologs in both species. Next, we compared intragenic DNA methylation levels in the fire ant and honey bee to comprehensive epigenetic and gene-regulatory data from Drosophila melanogaster orthologs. We observed striking evidence of a conserved association between DNA methylation in fire ants and honey bees, and several active histone modifications, constitutive gene expression, and broad promoter architecture in D. melanogaster. Overall, our study illustrates that DNA methylation is a single component of a conserved, integrated, multilayered epigenetic and regulatory landscape in insect genomes.",2013,5,591-598,10.1093/gbe/evt030

1068,N,Genomic Landscape of Methylation Islands in Hymenopteran Insects,Genome Biology and Evolution,"Recent genome-wide DNA methylation analyses of insect genomes accentuate an intriguing contrast compared with those in mammals. In mammals, most CpGs are heavily methylated, with the exceptions of clusters of hypomethylated sites referred to as CpG islands. In contrast, DNA methylation in insects is localized to a small number of CpG sites. Here, we refer to clusters of methylated CpGs as methylation islands (MIs), and investigate their characteristics in seven hymenopteran insects with high-quality bisulfite sequencing data. Methylation islands were primarily located within gene bodies. They were significantly overrepresented in exon-intron boundaries, indicating their potential roles in splicing. Methylated CpGs within MIs exhibited stronger evolutionary conservation compared with those outside of MIs. Additionally, genes harboring MIs exhibited higher and more stable levels of gene expression compared with those that do not harbor MIs. The effects of MIs on evolutionary conservation and gene expression are independent and stronger than the effect of DNA methylation alone. These results indicate that MIs may be useful to gain additional insights into understanding the role of DNA methylation in gene expression and evolutionary conservation in invertebrate genomes.",2018,10,2766-2776,10.1093/gbe/evy203

For example, in higher vertebrates, there is a global methylation pattern involving complete methylation of CpG sites genome-wide, except in promoter regions that are typically enriched for CpG dinucleotides, or so called CpGislands. Here, we comprehensively examined and compared the distribution of CpG sites within ten model eukaryotic species and linked the observed patterns to the role of DNA methylation in controlling gene transcription. The analysis revealed two distinct but conserved methylation patterns for gene promoters in human and mouse genomes, involving genes with distinct distributions of promoter CpGs and gene expression patterns. Comparative analysis with four other higher vertebrates revealed that the primary regulatory role of the DNA methylation system is highly conserved in higher vertebrates.",2014,6,2998-3014,10.1093/gbe/evu238

1072,N,Evolutionary Transition of Promoter and Gene Body DNA Methylation across Invertebrate-Vertebrate Boundary,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"Genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates exhibit highly divergent patterns of DNA methylation. Invertebrate genomes tend to be sparsely methylated, and DNA methylation is mostly targeted to a subset of transcription units (gene bodies). In a drastic contrast, vertebrate genomes are generally globally and heavily methylated, punctuated by the limited local hypo-methylation of putative regulatory regions such as promoters. These genomic differences also translate into functional differences in DNA methylation and gene regulation. Although promoter DNA methylation is an important regulatory component of vertebrate gene expression, its role in invertebrate gene regulation has been little explored. Instead, gene body DNA methylation is associated with expression of invertebrate genes. However, the evolutionary steps leading to the differentiation of invertebrate and vertebrate genomic DNA methylation remain unresolved. Here we analyzed experimentally determined DNA methylation maps of several species across the invertebrate-vertebrate boundary, to elucidate how vertebrate gene methylation has evolved. We show that, in contrast to the prevailing idea, a substantial number of promoters in an invertebrate basal chordate Ciona intestinalis are methylated. Moreover, gene expression data indicate significant, epigenomic context-dependent associations between promoter methylation and expression in C. intestinalis. However, there is no evidence that promoter methylation in invertebrate chordate has been evolutionarily maintained across the invertebrate-vertebrate boundary. Rather, body-methylated invertebrate genes preferentially obtain hypo-methylated promoters among vertebrates. Conversely, promoter methylation is preferentially found in lineage- and tissue-specific vertebrate genes. These results provide important insights into the evolutionary origin of epigenetic regulation of vertebrate gene expression.",2016,33,1019-1028,10.1093/molbev/msv345
1073,N,Epigenetic regulation of transcriptional plasticity associated with developmental song learning,Proceedings of the Royal Soceity B-Biological Sciences,"Ethologists discovered over 100 years ago that some lifelong behavioural patterns were acquired exclusively during restricted developmental phases called critical periods (CPs). Developmental song learning in zebra finches is one of the most striking examples of a CP for complex learned behaviour. After post-hatch day 65, whether or not a juvenile male can memorize the song of a 'tutor' depends on his experiences in the month prior. If he experienced a tutor, he can no longer learn, but if he has been isolated from hearing a tutor the learning period is extended. We aimed to identify how tutor experience alters the brain and controls the ability to learn. Epigenetic landscapes are modulated by experience and are able to regulate the transcription of sets of genes, thereby affecting cellular function. Thus, we hypothesized that tutor experiences determine the epigenetic landscape in the auditory forebrain, a region required for tutor song memorization. Using ChIPseq, RNAseq and molecular biology, we provide evidence that naturalistic experiences associated with the ability to learn can induce epigenetic changes, and propose transcriptional plasticity as a mediator of CP learning potential.",2018,285,20180160,10.1098 spb.2018.0160
1074,N,Intraspecific DNA methylation polymorphism in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.),Journal of Heredity,"Cytosine methylation is important in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and development in plants and has been implicated in silencing duplicate genes after polyploid formation in several plant groups. Relatively little information exists, however, on levels and patterns of methylation polymorphism (MP) at homologous loci within species. Here we explored the levels and patterns of methylation-polymorphism diversity at CCGG sites within allotetraploid cotton, Gossypium hirsutum, using a methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism screen and a selected set of 20 G. hirsutum accessions for which we have information on genetic polymorphism levels and relationships. Methylation and MP exist at high levels within G. hirsutum: of 150 HpaII/MspI sites surveyed, 48 were methylated at the inner cytosine (32%) and 32 of these were polymorphic (67%). Both these values are higher than comparable measures of genetic diversity using restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The high percentage of methylation-polymorphic sites and potential relationship to gene expression Underscore the potential significance of MP within and among populations.

1077,N,Population Evolution of Helicobacter pylori through Diversification in DNA Methylation and Interstrain Sequence Homogenization,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"Decoding of closely related genomes is now revealing the process of population evolution. In bacteria, population divergence appears associated with a unique set of sequence-specific epigenetic DNA methylation systems, often within restriction-modification (RM) systems. They might define a unique gene expression pattern and limit genetic flux between lineages in population divergence. We addressed the contribution of methylation systems to population diversification in panmictic bacterial species, Helicobacter pylori, which shows an interconnected population structure through frequent mutual recombination. We analyzed complete genome sequences of 28 strains collected in Fukui, Japan. Their nucleotide sequences are closely related although fine-scale analyses revealed two subgroups likely reflecting human subpopulations. Their sequences are tightly connected by homologous recombination. Our extensive analysis of RM systems revealed an extreme variability in DNA methyltransferases, especially in their target recognition domains. Their diversity was, however, not immediately related to the genome sequence diversity, except for very closely related strains. An interesting exception is a hybrid strain, which likely has conserved the methylation gene repertoire from one parent but diversified in sequence by massive acquisition of fragmentary DNA sequences from the other parent. Our results demonstrate how a bacterial population can be extremely divergent in epigenetics and yet homogenized in sequence.",2016,33,2848-2859,10.1093/molbev/msw162

1079,N,Effects of acclimation time and epigenetic mechanisms on growth of Neurospora in fluctuating environments,Heredity,"Reaction norms or tolerance curves have often been used to predict how organisms deal with fluctuating environments. A potential drawback is that reaction norms measured in different constant environments may not capture all aspects of organismal responses to fluctuating environments. We examined growth of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa in fluctuating temperatures and tested if growth in fluctuating temperatures can be explained simply by the growth in different constant temperatures or if more complex models are needed. In addition, as previous studies on fluctuating environments have revealed that past temperatures that organisms have experienced can affect their response to current temperature, we tested the roles of different epigenetic mechanisms in response to fluctuating environments using different mutants. We found that growth of Neurospora can be predicted in fluctuating temperatures to some extent if acclimation times are taken into account in the model. Interestingly, while fluctuating environments have been linked with epigenetic responses, we found only some evidence of involvement of epigenetic mechanisms on tolerating fluctuating temperatures. Mutants which lacked H3K4 or H3K36 methylation had slightly impaired response to temperature fluctuations, in addition the H3K4 methylation mutant and a mutant in the RNA interference pathway had altered acclimation times.",2018,121,327-341,10.1038/s41437-018-0138-2
1080,N,A possible role of DNA methylation in functional divergence of a fast evolving duplicate gene encoding odorant binding protein 11 in the honeybee,Proceedings of the Royal Soceity B-Biological Sciences,"Although gene duplication is seen as the main path to evolution of new functions, molecular mechanisms by which selection favours the gain versus loss of newly duplicated genes and minimizes the fixation of pseudo-genes are not well understood. Here, we investigate in detail a duplicate honeybee gene obp11 belonging to a fast evolving insect gene family encoding odorant binding proteins (OBPs). We report that obp11 is expressed only in female bees in rare antennal sensilla basiconica in contrast to its tandem partner obp10 that is expressed in the brain in both females and males (drones). Unlike all other obp genes in the honeybee, obp11 is methylated suggesting that functional diversification of obp11 and obp10 may have been driven by an epigenetic mechanism. We also show that increased methylation in drones near one donor splice site that correlates with higher abundance of a transcript variant encoding a truncated OBP11 protein is one way of controlling its contrasting expression. Our data suggest that like in mammals and plants, DNA methylation in insects may contribute to functional diversification of proteins produced from duplicated genes, in particular to their subfunctionalization by generating complementary patterns of expression.",2016,283,20160558,10.1098 spb.2016.0558
1081,N,Pattern of DNA Methylation in Daphnia : Evolutionary Perspective,Genome Biology and Evolution,"DNA methylation is an evolutionary ancient epigenetic modification that is phylogenetically widespread. Comparative studies of the methylome across a diverse range of non-conventional and conventional model organisms is expected to help reveal how the landscape of DNA methylation and its functions have evolved. Here, we explore the DNA methylation profile of two species of the crustacean Daphnia using whole genome bisulfite sequencing. We then compare our data with the methylomes of two insects and two mammals to achieve a better understanding of the function of DNA methylation in Daphnia. Using RNA-sequencing data for all six species, we investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. DNA methylation in Daphnia is mainly enriched within the coding regions of genes, with the highest methylation levels observed at exons 2-4. In contrast, vertebrate genomes are globally methylated, and increase towards the highest methylation levels observed at exon 2, and maintained across the rest of the gene body. Although DNA methylation patterns differ among all species, their methylation profiles share a bimodal distribution across the genomes. Genes with low levels of CpG methylation and gene expression are mainly enriched for species specific genes. In contrast, genes associated with high methylated CpG sites are highly transcribed and evolutionary conserved across all species. Finally, the positive correlation between internal exons and gene expression potentially points to an evolutionary conserved mechanism, whereas the negative regulation of gene expression via methylation of promoters and exon 1 is potentially a secondary mechanism that has been evolved in vertebrates.",2018,10,1988-2007,10.1093/gbe/evy155

Levofloxacin (LOF) is an ideal anti-tuberculosis drug in clinical applications. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis in TB treatment have not been revealed. Our study performed transcriptome and methylome sequencing to investigate the potential biological characteristics of LOF resistance in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In the transcriptome analysis, 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified; 514 and 439 DEGs were significantly downregulated and upregulated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 97 pathways were enriched in this study. In the methylome analysis, 239 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified; 150 and 89 DMGs were hypomethylated and hypermethylated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 74 pathways were enriched in this study. The overlap study suggested that 25 genes were obtained. It was notable that nine genes expressed downregulated mRNA and upregulated methylated levels, including pgi, fadE4, php, cyp132, pckA, rpmB1, pfkB, acg, and ctpF, especially cyp132, pckA, and pfkB, which were vital in LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

1087,N,Mercury methylation by metabolically versatile and cosmopolitan marine bacteria,ISME Journal,"Microbes transform aqueous mercury (Hg) into methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin that accumulates in terrestrial and marine food webs, with potential impacts on human health. This process requires the gene pair hgcAB, which encodes for proteins that actuate Hg methylation, and has been well described for anoxic environments. However, recent studies report potential MeHg formation in suboxic seawater, although the microorganisms involved remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted large-scale multi-omic analyses to search for putative microbial Hg methylators along defined redox gradients in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, a model natural ecosystem with previously measured Hg and MeHg concentration profiles. Analysis of gene expression profiles along the redoxcline identified several putative Hg methylating microbial groups, including Calditrichaeota, SAR324 and Marinimicrobia, with the last the most active based on hgc transcription levels. Marinimicrobia hgc genes were identified from multiple publicly available marine metagenomes, consistent with a potential key role in marine Hg methylation. Computational homology modelling predicts that Marinimicrobia HgcAB proteins contain the highly conserved amino acid sites and folding structures required for functional Hg methylation. Furthermore, a number of terminal oxidases from aerobic respiratory chains were associated with several putative novel Hg methylators. Our findings thus reveal potential novel marine Hg-methylating microorganisms with a greater oxygen tolerance and broader habitat range than previously recognized.",2021,15,1810-1825,10.1038/s41396-020-00889-4
1088,N,Rapid changes in DNA methylation associated with the initiation of reproduction in a small songbird,Molecular Ecology,"Species with a circannual life cycle need to match the timing of their life history events to the environment to maximize fitness. However, our understanding of how circannual traits such as timing of reproduction are regulated on a molecular level remains limited. Recent studies have implicated that epigenetic mechanisms can be an important part in the processes that regulate circannual traits. Here, we explore the role of DNA methylation in mediating reproductive timing in a seasonally breeding bird species, the great tit (Parus major), using genome-wide DNA methylation data from individual females that were blood sampled repeatedly throughout the breeding season. We demonstrate rapid and directional changes in DNA methylation within the promoter region of several genes, including a key transcription factor (NR5A1) known from earlier studies to be involved in the initiation of timing of reproduction. Interestingly, the observed changes in DNA methylation at NR5A1 identified here are in line with earlier gene expression studies of reproduction in chicken, indicating that the observed shifts in DNA methylation at this gene can have a regulatory role. Our findings provide an important step towards elucidating the genomic mechanism that mediates seasonal timing of a key life history traits and provide support for the idea that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in circannual traits.",2021,0,15-Jan,10.1111/mec.15803

The results show that the nucleolus organizing region (NOR) located distally on the B chromosome is not methylated in embryos or in gastric caeca of adult males and females, but it is methylated in ovariole cells and spermatocytes in both last instar nymphs and adults. Demethylation of the B-NOR during early embryogenesis is proposed for the observed methylation pattern in embryos. Despite variation in methylation status through the life cycle, rRNA genes contained in the B-NOR were never observed to be active, which indicates that DNA methylation is not the direct cause of their inactivity.

1091,N,Angiosperms Are Unique among Land Plant Lineages in the Occurrence of Key Genes in the RNA-Directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) Pathway,Genome Biology and Evolution,"The RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway can be divided into three phases: 1) small interfering RNA biogenesis, 2) de novo methylation, and 3) chromatin modification. To determine the degree of conservation of this pathway we searched for key genes among land plants. We used OrthoMCL and the OrthoMCL Viridiplantae database to analyze proteomes of species in bryophytes, lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. We also analyzed small RNA size categories and, in two gymnosperms, cytosine methylation in ribosomal DNA. Six proteins were restricted to angiosperms, these being NRPD4 RPE4, RDM1, DMS3 (defective in meristem silencing 3), SHH1 (SAWADEE homeodomain homolog 1), KTF1, and SUVR2, although we failed to find the latter three proteins in Fritillaria persica, a species with a giant genome. Small RNAs of 24 nt in length were abundant only in angiosperms. Phylogenetic analyses of Dicer-like (DCL) proteins showed that DCL2 was restricted to seed plants, although it was absent in Gnetum gnemon and Welwitschia mirabills. The data suggest that phases (1) and (2) of the RdDM pathway, described for model angiosperms, evolved with angiosperms. The absence of some features of RdDM in F. persica may be associated with its large genome. Phase (3) is probably the most conserved part of the pathway across land plants. DC L2, involved in virus defense and interaction with the canonical RdDM pathway to facilitate methylation of CHH, is absent outside seed plants. Its absence in G. gnemon, and W. mirabilis coupled with distinctive patterns of CHH methylation, suggest a secondary loss of DCL2 following the divergence of Gnetales.",2015,7,2648-2662,10.1093/gbe/evv171
1092,N,Bumblebee Workers Show Differences in Allele-Specific DNA Methylation and Allele-Specific Expression,Genome Biology and Evolution,"Allele-specific expression is when one allele of a gene shows higher levels of expression compared with the other allele, in a diploid organism. Recent work has identified allele-specific expression in a number of Hymenopteran species. However, the molecular mechanism which drives this allelic expression bias remains unknown. In mammals, DNA methylation is often associated with genes which show allele-specific expression. DNA methylation systems have been described in species of Hymenoptera, providing a candidate mechanism. Using previously generated RNA-Seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from reproductive and sterile bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers, we have identified genome-wide allele-specific expression and allele-specific DNA methylation. The majority of genes displaying allele-specific expression are common between reproductive and sterile workers and the proportion of allele-specific expression bias generally varies between genetically distinct colonies. We have also identified genome-wide allele-specific DNA methylation patterns in both reproductive and sterile workers, with reproductive workers showing significantly more genes with allele-specific methylation. Finally, there is no significant overlap between genes showing allele-specific expression and allele-specific methylation. These results indicate that cis-acting DNA methylation does not directly drive genome-wide allele-specific expression in this species.",2020,12,1471-1481,10.1093/gbe/evaa132

Here, using whole genome bisulphite sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), we present the first detailed analysis of cytosine methylation in an aphid and investigate differences in the methylation and transcriptional landscapes of male and asexual female morphs. We found that methylation primarily occurs in a CG dinucleotide (CpG) context and that exons are highly enriched for methylated CpGs, particularly at the 3 ' end of genes. Methylation is positively associated with gene expression, and methylated genes are more stably expressed than unmethylated genes. Male and asexual female morphs have distinct methylation profiles. Strikingly, these profiles are divergent between the sex chromosome and the autosomes; autosomal genes are hypomethylated in males compared to asexual females, whereas genes belonging to the sex chromosome, which is haploid in males, are hypermethylated. Overall, we found correlated changes in methylation and gene expression between males and asexual females, and this correlation was particularly strong for genes located on the sex chromosome. Our results suggest that differential methylation of sex-biased genes plays a role in aphid sexual differentiation.",2019,28,4228-4241,10.1111/mec.15216

The parental genetic contributions to the zygote are, initially, differently methylated with the genome of the sperm being hypermethylated relative to the genome of the oocyte. Post-fertilization there is an immediate decrease in methylation of the embryonic genome but the methylation begins to increase rapidly and is re-established by the gastrulation stage. These results are consistent with the results of Santos et al.

1100,N,Dynamic mercury methylation and demethylation in oligotrophic marine water,Biogeosciences,"Mercury bioaccumulation in open-ocean food webs depends on the net rate of inorganic mercury conversion to monomethylmercury in the water column. We measured significant methylation rates across large gradients in oxygen utilization in the oligotrophic central Pacific Ocean. Overall, methylation rates over 24 h incubation periods were comparable to those previously published from Arctic and Mediterranean waters despite differences in productivity between these marine environments. In contrast to previous studies that have attributed Hg methylation to heterotrophic bacteria, we measured higher methylation rates in filtered water compared to unfiltered water. Furthermore, we observed enhanced demethylation of newly produced methylated mercury in incubations of unfiltered water relative to filtered water. The addition of station-specific bulk filtered particulate matter, a source of inorganic mercury substrate and other possibly influential compounds, did not stimulate sustained methylation, although transient enhancement of methylation occurred within 8 h of addition. The addition of dissolved inorganic cobalt also produced dramatic, if transient, increases in mercury methylation. Our results suggest important roles for noncellular or extracellular methylation mechanisms and demethylation in determining methylated mercury concentrations in marine oligotrophic waters. Methylation and demethylation occur dynamically in the open-ocean water column, even in regions with low accumulation of methylated mercury.",2018,15,6451-6460,10.5194/bg-15-6451-2018

A recent study discovered the loss of gbM in two plant species (Eutrema salsugineum and Conringia planisiliqua), illustrating that gbM is not necessary for survival and reproduction. The same paper stated there was no detectable effect of gbM loss on gene expression (GE). Here, we reanalyzed the GE data and accounted for experimental variability in expression level estimates. We show that the loss of gbM in E. salsugineum is associated with a small but highly significant decrease in GE relative to the closely related species Arabidospis thaliana. Our results are consistent with various evolutionary analyses that suggest gbM has a function, perhaps as a homeostatic effect on GE.",2019,36,155-158,10.1093/molbev/msy204

1106,N,Exploring DNA methylation patterns in copper exposed Folsomia candida and Enchytraeus crypticus,Pedobiologia,"Accumulating evidence shows that epigenetics-mediated phenotypic plasticity plays a role in an organism's ability to deal with environmental stress. However, to date, the role of epigenetic modifications in response to stress is hardly investigated in soil invertebrates. The main objective of this proof of principle study was to explore whether total cytosine and locus-specific CpG methylation are present in two important ecotoxicological model organisms, the springtail Folsomia candida and the potworm Enchytraeus crypticus, and if so, whether methylation patterns might change with increased toxicant exposure. LC-MS/MS analyses and bisulfite sequencing were performed to identify the CpG methylation state of the organisms. We show here, for the first time, a total level of 1.4% 5-methyl cytosine methylation in the genome of E. crypticus, and an absence of both total cytosine and locus-specific CpG methylation in F. candida. In E. crypticus, methylation of CpG sites was observed in the coding sequence (CDS) of the housekeeping gene Elongation Factor 1 alpha, while the CDS of the stress inducible Heat Shock Protein 70 gene almost lacked methylation. This confirms previous observations that DNA methylation differs between housekeeping and stress-inducible genes in invertebrates. DNA methylation patterns in E. crypticus were not affected by exposure to copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O) mixed in with LUFA 2.2 soil at sublethal effect concentrations that decreased reproduction by 10%, 20% and 50%. Although, differences in CpG methylation patterns between specific loci suggest a functional role for DNA methylation in E. crypticus, genome-wide bisulfite sequencing is needed to verify whether environmental stress affects this epigenetic hallmark.",2018,66,52-57,10.1016/j.pedobi.2017.10.001

1110,N,Comparative Analyses of DNA Methylation and Sequence Evolution Using Nasonia Genomes,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"The functional and evolutionary significance of DNA methylation in insect genomes remains to be resolved. Nasonia is well situated for comparative analyses of DNA methylation and genome evolution, since the genomes of a moderately distant outgroup species as well as closely related sibling species are available. Using direct sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA, we uncovered a substantial level of DNA methylation in 17 of 18 Nasonia vitripennis genes and a strong correlation between methylation level and CpG depletion. Notably, in the sex-determining locus transformer, the exon that is alternatively spliced between the sexes is heavily methylated in both males and females, whereas other exons are only sparsely methylated. Orthologous genes of the honeybee and Nasonia show highly similar relative levels of CpG depletion, despite similar to 190 My divergence. Densely and sparsely methylated genes in these species also exhibit similar functional enrichments. We found that the degree of CpG depletion is negatively correlated with substitution rates between closely related Nasonia species for synonymous, nonsynonymous, and intron sites. This suggests that mutation rates increase with decreasing levels of germ line methylation. Thus, DNA methylation is prevalent in the Nasonia genome, may participate in regulatory processes such as sex determination and alternative splicing, and is correlated with several aspects of genome and sequence evolution.",2011,28,3345-3354,10.1093/molbev/msr168

1113,N,Signatures o DNA Methylation across Insects Suggest Reduced DNA Methylation Levels in Holometabola,Genome Biology and Evolution,"It has been experimentally shown that DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression and the silencing of transposable element activity in eukaryotes. The variable levels of DNA methylation among different insect species indicate an evolutionarily flexible role of DNA methylation in insects, which due to a lack of comparative data is not yet well-substantiated. Here, we use computational methods to trace signatures of DNA methylation across insects by analyzing transcriptomic and genomic sequence data from all currently recognized insect orders. We conclude that: 1) a functional methylation system relying exclusively on DNA methyltransferase 1 is widespread across insects. 2) DNA methylation has potentially been lost or extremely reduced in species belonging to springtails (Collembola), flies and relatives (Diptera), and twisted-winged parasites (Strepsiptera). 3) Holometabolous insects display signs of reduced DNA methylation levels in protein-coding sequences compared with hemimetabolous insects. 4) Evolutionarily conserved insect genes associated with housekeeping functions tend to display signs of heavier DNA methylation in comparison to the genomic/transcriptomic background. With this comparative study, we provide the much needed basis for experimental and detailed comparative analyses required to gain a deeper understanding on the evolution and function of DNA methylation in insects.",2018,10,1185-1197,10.1093/gbe/evy066

1116,N,Improved demethylation in ecological epigenetic experiments: Testing a simple and harmless foliar demethylation application,Methods in Ecology and Evolution,"Experimental demethylation of plant DNA enables testing for epigenetic effects in a simple and straightforward way without the use of expensive and laborious DNA sequencing. Plants are commonly demethylated during their germination with the application of agents such as 5-azacytidine (5-azaC). However, this approach can cause unwanted effects such as underdeveloped root systems and high mortality of treated plants, hindering a full comparison with untreated plants, and can be applied only on plant reproducing by seeds. Here we test a simple alternative method of plant demethylation designed to overcome the shortcomings of the germinating method. We compared a novel method of demethylating plants, based on periodical spraying of 5-azaC aqueous solution on established seedlings, with the previous method in which seeds were germinated directly in 5-azaC solution. We quantified the amount of methylated DNA and measured various aspects of plant performance. Also, we demonstrated its applicability in ecological epigenetic experiments by testing transgenerational effects of plant-plant competition. We found that the spray application had similar DNA-demethylating efficiency than the germination method, particularly in the earlier phases of plant development, but without unwanted effects. The spray application method did not reduce plant growth and performance compared to untreated plants, as opposed to the traditional method which showed reduced growth. Also, the spray application method equalized the epigenetically modified plant features of seedlings coming from plants grown under competition and plants growing without competition, demonstrating its application in ecological epigenetic experiments. We conclude that regular spraying of 5-azaC solution onto established seedlings surpassed the germination-in-solution method in terms of vigour and fitness of treated plants. This novel method could thus be better suited for experimental studies seeking valuable insights into ecological epigenetics. Furthermore, the spray method can be suitable for clonal species reproducing asexually, and most importantly, it opens the possibility of community-level experimental demethylation of plants.",2018,9,744-753,10.1111/2041-210X.12903

1120,N,Changes in melanocyte RNA and DNA methylation favour pheomelanin synthesis and may avoid systemic oxidative stress after dietary cysteine supplementation in birds,Molecular Ecology,"Cysteine plays essential biological roles, but excessive amounts produce cellular oxidative stress. Cysteine metabolism is mainly mediated by the enzymes cysteine dioxygenase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, respectively coded by the genes CDO1 and GCLC. Here we test a new hypothesis posing that the synthesis of the pigment pheomelanin also contributes to cysteine homeostasis in melanocytes, where cysteine can enter the pheomelanogenesis pathway. We conducted an experiment with the Eurasian nuthatch Sitta europaea, a bird producing large amounts of pheomelanin for feather pigmentation, to investigate if melanocytes show epigenetic lability under exposure to excess cysteine. We increased systemic cysteine levels in nuthatches by supplementing them with dietary cysteine during growth. In feather melanocytes this led to the downregulation of genes involved in intracellular cysteine metabolism (GCLC), cysteine transport to the cytosol from the extracellular medium (Slc7a11) and from melanosomes (CTNS), and regulation of tyrosinase activity (MC1R and ASIP). These changes were mediated by increases in DNA m(5)C in all genes except Slc7a11, which experienced RNA m(6)A depletion. Birds supplemented with cysteine synthesized more pheomelanin than controls, but did not suffer higher systemic oxidative stress. These results suggest that excess cysteine activates an epigenetic mechanism that favours pheomelanin synthesis and may protect against oxidative stress.",2019,28,1030-1042,10.1111/mec.15024

1122,N,Museum epigenomics: Characterizing cytosine methylation in historic museum specimens,Molecular Ecology Resources,"Museum genomics has transformed the field of collections-based research, opening up a range of new research directions for paleontological specimens as well as natural history specimens collected over the past few centuries. Recent work demonstrates that it is possible to characterize epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation in well preserved ancient tissues. This approach has not yet been tested in traditionally prepared natural history specimens such as dried bones and skins, the most common specimen types in vertebrate collections. In this study, we developed and tested methods to characterize cytosine methylation in dried skulls up to 76 years old. Using a combination of ddRAD and bisulphite treatment, we characterized patterns of cytosine methylation in two species of deer mouse (Peromyscus spp.) collected in the same region in Michigan in 1940, 2003, and 2013-2016. We successfully estimated methylation in specimens of all age groups, although older specimens yielded less data and showed greater interindividual variation in data yield than newer specimens. Global methylation estimates were reduced in the oldest specimens (76 years old) relative to the newest specimens (1-3 years old), which may reflect post-mortem hydrolytic deamination. Methylation was reduced in promoter regions relative to gene bodies and showed greater bimodality in autosomes relative to female X chromosomes, consistent with expectations for methylation in mammalian somatic cells. Our work demonstrates the utility of historic specimens for methylation analyses, as with genomic analyses; however, studies will need to accommodate the large variance in the quantity of data produced by older specimens.",2020,20,1161-1170,10.1111/1755-0998.13115

1126,N,Scoring and analysis of methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphisms for epigenetic population studies,Molecular Ecology Resources,"DNA methylation is an important, heritable epigenetic modification in most eukaryotic organisms that is connected with numerous biological processes. To study the impact of natural epigenetic variation in an ecological or evolutionary context, epigenetic studies are increasingly using methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) for surveys at the population or species level. However, no consensus exists on how to interpret and score the multistate information obtained from the MSAP banding patterns. Here, we review the previously used scoring approaches for population epigenetic studies and develop new alternatives. To assess effects of the different approaches on parameters of epigenetic diversity and differentiation, we applied eight scoring schemes to a case study of three populations of the plant species Viola elatior. For a total number of 168 detected polymorphic MSAP fragments, the number of ultimately scored polymorphic epiloci ranged between 78 and 286 depending on the particular scoring scheme. Both, estimates of epigenetic diversity and differentiation varied strongly between scoring approaches. However, linear regression and PCoA revealed qualitatively similar patterns, suggesting that the scoring approaches are largely consistent. For single-locus analyses of MSAP data, for example the search for loci under selection, we advocate a new scoring approach that separately takes into account different methylation types and thus seems appropriate for drawing more detailed conclusions in ecological or evolutionary contexts. An R script (MSAP_score.r) for scoring and basic data analysis is provided.",2013,13,642-653,10.1111/1755-0998.12100

Most importantly, gbM genes tend to maintain their level of DNA methylation between species, suggesting that this trait is under evolutionary constraint. Given the degree of conservation in gbM, we still know surprisingly little about its function in plant genomes or whether gbM is itself a target of selection. To address these questions, we surveyed DNA methylation across eight grass (Poaceae) species that span a gradient of genome sizes. We first established that genome size correlates with genome-wide DNA methylation levels, but less so for genic levels. We then leveraged genomic data to identify a set of 2,982 putative orthologs among the eight species and examined shifts of methylation status for each ortholog in a phylogenetic context. A total of 55% of orthologs exhibited a shift in gbM, but these shifts occurred predominantly on terminal branches, indicating that shifts in gbM are rarely conveyed over time. Finally, we found that the degree of conservation of gbM across species is associated with increased gene length, reduced rates of molecular evolution, and increased gene expression level, but reduced gene expression variation across species.

1140,N,The Evolutionary Dynamics of Orthologs That Shift in Gene Body Methylation between Arabidopsis Species,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"DNA methylation labels a specific subset of genes in plant genomes. Recent work has shown that this gene-body methylation (gbM) is a conserved feature of orthologs, because highly methylated genes in one species tend to be highly methylated in another. In this study, we examined the exceptions to that rule by identifying genes that differ in gbM status between two plant species-Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata. Using Capsella grandiflora as an out-group, we polarized the loss and gain of gbM for orthologs in the Arabidopsis lineage. Our survey identified a few hundred genes that differed between ingroup species, out of similar to 9,000 orthologs. The estimated rate of gbM gain was similar to 2 x 10(-9) per gene per year for both ingroup taxa and was similar to the loss rate in A. lyrata. In contrast, A. thaliana had a similar to 3-fold higher estimated rate of gbM loss per gene, consistent with a recent diminishment of genome size. As in previous studies, we found that body-methylated genes were expressed broadly across tissues and were also longer than other genic sets. Genes that differed in gbM status exhibited higher variance in expression between species than genes that were body-methylated in both species. Moreover, the gain of gbM in one lineage tended to be associated with an increase of expression in that lineage. The genes that varied in gbM status between species varied more significantly in length between species than other sets of genes; we hypothesize that length is a key feature in the transition between body-methylated and nonmethylated genes.",2017,34,1479-1491,10.1093/molbev/msx099
1141,N,Cross-Species Analysis of Genic GC(3) Content and DNA Methylation Patterns,Genome Biology and Evolution,"The GC content in the third codon position (GC(3)) exhibits a unimodal distribution in many plant and animal genomes. Interestingly, grasses and homeotherm vertebrates exhibit a unique bimodal distribution. High GC(3) was previously found to be associated with variable expression, higher frequency of upstream TATA boxes, and an increase of GC(3) from 5' to 3'. Moreover, GC(3)-rich genes are predominant in certain gene classes and are enriched in CpG dinucleotides that are potential targets for methylation. Based on the GC(3) bimodal distribution we hypothesize that GC(3) has a regulatory role involving methylation and gene expression. To test that hypothesis, we selected diverse taxa (rice, thale cress, bee, and human) that varied in the modality of their GC(3) distribution and tested the association between GC(3), DNA methylation, and gene expression. We examine the relationship between cytosine methylation levels and GC(3), gene expression, genome signature, gene length, and other gene compositional features. We find a strong negative correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = -0.67, Pvalue<0.0001) between GC(3) and genic CpG methylation. The comparison between 5'-3' gradients of CG(3)-skew and genic methylation for the taxa in the study suggests interplay between gene-body methylation and transcription-coupled cytosine deamination effect. Compositional features are correlated with methylation levels of genes in rice, thale cress, human, bee, and fruit fly (which acts as an unmethylated control). These patterns allow us to generate evolutionary hypotheses about the relationships between GC(3) and methylation and how these affect expression patterns. Specifically, we propose that the opposite effects of methylation and compositional gradients along coding regions of GC(3)-poor and GC(3)-rich genes are the products of several competing processes.",2013,5,1443-1456,10.1093/gbe/evt103

Although mismatched genomes can lead to fitness changes, in some cases the reduction in hybrid fitness is subtle. The potential role of transcriptional regulation in admixed genomes could provide a mechanistic explanation for these discrepancies, but evidence is lacking for nonmodel organisms. Here, we explored the intersection of genetics and gene regulation in admixed genomes derived from an experimental cross between a western gray wolf and western coyote. We found a significant positive association between methylation and wolf ancestry, and identified outlier genes that have been previously implicated in inbreeding-related, or otherwise deleterious, phenotypes. We describe a pattern of site-specific, rather than genome-wide, methylation driven by inter-specific hybridization. Epigenetic variation is thus suggested to play a nontrivial role in both maintaining and combating mismatched genotypes through putative transcriptional mechanisms. We conclude that the regulation of gene expression is an underappreciated key component of hybrid genome functioning, but could also act as a potential source of novel and beneficial adaptive variation in hybrid offspring.",2017,108,341-348,10.1093/jhered/esx004
1153,N,Rapid Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations under Intergeneric Genomic Shock in Newly Synthesized Chrysanthemum morifolium x Leucanthemum paludosum Hybrids (Asteraceae),Genome Biology and Evolution,"The Asteraceae family is at the forefront of the evolution due to frequent hybridization. Hybridization is associated with the induction of widespread genetic and epigenetic changes and has played an important role in the evolution of many plant taxa. We attempted the intergeneric cross Chrysanthemum morifolium x Leucanthemum paludosum. To obtain the success in cross, we have to turn to ovule rescue. DNA profiling of the amphihaploid and amphidiploid was investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism, sequence-related amplified polymorphism, start codon targeted polymorphism, and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). Hybridization induced rapid changes at the genetic and the epigenetic levels. The genetic changes mainly involved loss of parental fragments and gaining of novel fragments, and some eliminated sequences possibly from the noncoding region of L. paludosum. The MSAP analysis indicated that the level of DNA methylation was lower in the amphiploid (similar to 45%) than in the parental lines (51.5-50.6%), whereas it increased after amphidiploid formation. Events associated with intergeneric genomic shock were a feature of C. morifolium x L. paludosum hybrid, given that the genetic relationship between the parental species is relatively distant. Our results provide genetic and epigenetic evidence for understanding genomic shock in wide crosses between species in Asteraceae and suggest a need to expand our current evolutionary framework to encompass a genetic/epigenetic dimension when seeking to understand wide crosses.",2014,6,247-259,10.1093/gbe/evu008

1156,N,Landscape of DNA Methylation on the Marsupial X,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"DNA methylation plays a key role in maintaining transcriptional silence on the inactive X chromosome of eutherian mammals. Beyond eutherians, there are limited genome wide data on DNA methylation from other vertebrates. Previous studies of X borne genes in various marsupial models revealed no differential DNA methylation of promoters between the sexes, leading to the conclusion that CpG methylation plays no role in marsupial X-inactivation. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we generated male and female CpG methylation profiles in four representative vertebrates (mouse, gray short-tailed opossum, platypus, and chicken). A variety of DNA methylation patterns were observed. Platypus and chicken displayed no large-scale differential DNA methylation between the sexes on the autosomes or the sex chromosomes. As expected, a metagene analysis revealed hypermethylation at transcription start sites (TSS) of genes subject to X-inactivation in female mice. This contrasted with the opossum, in which metagene analysis did not detect differential DNA methylation between the sexes at TSSs of genes subject to X-inactivation. However, regions flanking TSSs of these genes were hypomethylated. Our data are the first to demonstrate that, for genes subject to X-inactivation in both eutherian and marsupial mammals, there is a consistent difference between DNA methylation levels at TSSs and immediate flanking regions, which we propose has a silencing effect in both groups.",2018,35,431-439,10.1093/molbev/msx297

1162,N,Impact of Transposable Elements on Methylation and Gene Expression across Natural Accessions of Brachypodium distachyon,Genome Biology and Evolution,"Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a large fraction of plant genomes and are mostly present in a transcriptionally silent state through repressive epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation. TE silencing is believed to influence the regulation of adjacent genes, possibly as DNA methylation spreads away from the TE. Whether this is a general principle or a context-dependent phenomenon is still under debate, pressing for studying the relationship between TEs, DNA methylation, and nearby gene expression in additional plant species. Here, we used the grass Brachypodium distachyon as a model and produced DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles for 11 natural accessions. In contrast to what is observed in Arabidopsis thaliana, we found that TEs have a limited impact on methylation spreading and that only few TE families are associated with a low expression of their adjacent genes. Interestingly, we found that a subset of TE insertion polymorphisms is associated with differential gene expression across accessions. Thus, although not having a global impact on gene expression, distinct TE insertions may contribute to specific gene expression patterns in B. distachyon.",2020,12,1994-2001,10.1093/gbe/evaa180

1164,N,Unique DNA Methylation Profiles Are Associated with cis-Variation in Honey Bees,Genome Biology and Evolution,"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that mediates diverse processes such as cellular differentiation, phenotypic plasticity, and genomic imprinting. Mounting evidence suggests that local DNA sequence variation can be associated with particular DNA methylation states, indicating that the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors may contribute synergistically to the phenotypic complexity of organisms. Social insects such as ants, bees, and wasps have extensive phenotypic plasticity manifested in their different castes, and this plasticity has been associated with variation in DNA methylation. Yet, the influence of genetic variation on DNA methylation state remains mostly unknown. Here we examine the importance of sequence-specific methylation at the genome-wide level, using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of the semen of individual honey bee males. We find that individual males harbor unique DNA methylation patterns in their semen, and that genes that are more variable at the epigenetic level are also more likely to be variable at the genetic level. DNA sequence variation can affect DNA methylation by modifying CG sites directly, but can also be associated with local variation in cis that is not CG-site specific. We show that covariation in sequence polymorphism and DNA methylation state contributes to the individual-specificity of epigenetic marks in social insects, which likely promotes their retention across generations, and their capacity to influence evolutionary adaptation.",2019,11,2517-2530,10.1093/gbe/evz177
1165,N,Analysis of Genomewide DNA Methylation Reveals Differences in DNA Methylation Levels between Dormant and Naturally as well as Artificially Potentiated Pedicle Periosteum of Sika Deer (Cervus nippon),Journal of Experimental Heredity Part B- Molecular and Developmental Evolution,"Deer antlers are the only mammalian appendages that can fully regenerate each year from the permanent bony protuberances of the frontal bones, called pedicles. Pedicle periosteum (PP) is the key tissue for antler regeneration and the source of antler stem cells. The distal one third of the PP has acquired the ability to regenerate antlers and is termed the potentiated PP (PPP), whereas the proximal two thirds of the PP requires further interactions within its niche to launch antler regeneration and is termed the dormant PP (DPP). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of potentiation from the DPP to the PPP are unknown. In this study, we used the fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism method to assess the levels of DNA methylation in both cells and tissues of the PPP and the DPP. The results showed that the levels of DNA methylation were significantly lower in the PPP compared to the DPP (P < 0.05). Therefore, DNA demethylation may be involved in the process of this potentiation. This involvement was further confirmed by functional testing by artificially creating a potentiated PP (aPPP) from DPP tissue. Moreover, we identified 15 methylated fragments by the methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism method that are either unique to the PPP or the DPP, which were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Taken together, our data suggest that DNA demethylation is involved in the process of PP potentiation, which is a prerequisite step for the initiation of antler regeneration. These findings provide the first experimental evidence to link epigenetic regulation and mammalian appendage regeneration. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016,326,375-383,10.1002/jez.b.22695
1166,N,"DNA Methylation and Genome Evolution in Honeybee: Gene Length, Expression, Functional Enrichment Covary with the Evolutionary Signature of DNA Methylation",Genome Biology and Evolution,"A growing body of evidence suggests that DNA methylation is functionally divergent among different taxa. The recently discovered functional methylation system in the honeybee Apis mellifera presents an attractive invertebrate model system to study evolution and function of DNA methylation. In the honeybee, DNA methylation is mostly targeted toward transcription units (gene bodies) of a subset of genes. Here, we report an intriguing covariation of length and epigenetic status of honeybee genes. Hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes in honeybee are dramatically different in their lengths for both exons and introns. By analyzing orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and Ciona intestinalis, we show genes that were short and long in the past are now preferentially situated in hyper- and hypomethylated classes respectively, in the honeybee. Moreover, we demonstrate that a subset of high-CpG genes are conspicuously longer than expected under the evolutionary relationship alone and that they are enriched in specific functional categories. We suggest that gene length evolution in the honeybee is partially driven by evolutionary forces related to regulation of gene expression, which in turn is associated with DNA methylation. However, lineage-specific patterns of gene length evolution suggest that there may exist additional forces underlying the observed interaction between DNA methylation and gene lengths in the honeybee.",2010,2,770-780,10.1093/gbe/evq060
1167,N,Epigenetic and transcriptional signatures of ex situ conserved golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana),Biological Conservation,"Extremely endangered wildlife can be effectively protected by ex situ conservation programs. Despite that, the effects of human activity on the health of captive populations are still unclear. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq, we assessed epigenetic and gene transcriptional variations between different types of human intervention (Custodial and Sanctuary groups) and a Wild group of golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana), which is one of the most endangered primates worldwide. Consequently, we found striking genome-scale divergence of both DNA methylation and gene expression for the Custodial group, which agreed with stronger human interventions on the food supply and management of the group. KEGG pathway analyses indicated that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in a wide range of physiologically functional pathways, most of which are involved in immune and metabolic functions. In particular, a group of core genes in autophagy related pathways, e.g., ATP6V0A1 and PPM1D, were both differentially expressed and methylated. Our findings revealed that the ex situ conserved golden snub-nosed monkey exhibited significant epigenetic and transcriptional adaptation to human intervention, thereby may provide a foundation for future biomarker development that can be used to evaluate the unintended risks of ex situ conservation programs for endangered animal species.",2019,237,175-184,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.06.021
1168,N,MSAP-based analysis of DNA methylation diversity in tobacco exposed to different environments and at different development phases,Biochemical Systematics and Ecology,"The DNA methylation phenomenon, which plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, exists in most eukaryotes. In this study, we employed methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technology to investigate the extent and patterns of methylation in tobacco planted in five different areas of Dali County, Yunnan Province. All of the samples were collected during the vegetative and reproductive growth phases. The data obtained from the MSAP analysis showed that full-methylation and non-methylation modifications were predominant and that the hemi-methylation modification ratio was markedly lower. The PCA and UPGMA analysis results indicated that the samples collected from different areas during the vegetative and reproductive growth phases exhibit certain differences: development had a more significant impact on the methylation diversity than environmental factors, although the samples collected at the same growth stages showed that the geographical environment may also affect the methylation status. The sequencing and BLASTn analyses indicated that most of the bands that showed significant polymorphisms are highly homologous to some methylation-sensitive-related sequences discovered in tobacco or other plant species and that many of these sequences are closely related to growth regulation or environmental factors.
